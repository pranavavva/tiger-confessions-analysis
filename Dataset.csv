12/26/2020 18:57:57,"Alright, so I am a student who is grateful to have received full aid here at Princeton, and I am hoping to have the experience and to join an eating club at some point. I have a lot of upperclassmen friends who are in Cannon, but I saw that they are the only eating club that does not specify or give any information about fees and assisting students in the eating club who are on need-based financial aid. I would love for a Cannon member or officer to respond or to provide more information about this. 

Also, I think am just kind of struck by the fact that there are different policies at different eating clubs for helping students finance being in an eating club. Compared to other universities, the system of eating clubs at Princeton appears on the face less exclusionary. But the lack of any financial assistance for low-income students seems is rather disturbing. Is there anyone right now who is trying to address this??",30008,

like I understand when uncountable nouns are in singular form like ""some water"" vs ""a lot of water""

But fruit is countable. But also I wouldn't say ""fruit ARE countable""

I am NOT thinking of things that typically are in singular form for both singular AND plural purposes (such as ""look at all this/these fish"") - I believe these are in a different category where they technically DO have a plural form, and it could be used, but it would feel weird-ish
I am also not thinking of things like ""pants"" that are just in plural form always (and yes it is plural form because you say ""where ARE my pants?"" vs ""where IS my shirt?"")
I am also not thinking of words that are in the same form for plural or singular, such as ""bison"" or ""glasses""

The comments from your mom must be annoying and invalidating, but the pain that you’re suffering must be worse and you shouldn’t have to go through it in any case. First, since she is concerned about your health, I would talk to her about medicine in general -  “natural” isn’t necessarily healthy - eg. untreated terminal illnesses. Healthy is feeling healthy, which is you thriving with the help of medication and continuing with your daily life like everyone else rather than being in debilitating pain every month. I personally took painkillers for period pain longterm, and the ibuprofen screwed up my digestive system. Birth control is considerably safer, and even is proven to lessen the chances of cancer - show her the data!

We have 4 months to see our on-campus friends after quarantine ends, please just quarantine and don’t see your friends that are still in their quarantine periods as well.

12/30/2020 3:43:57,"some of you might recognize me as ive posted this hot take on Crazy Rich Asians in another group before but for anyone who hasn’t heard it:

THIS IS GOING TO BE LONG

i know this movie and maybe even discussion is old but i very very recently had a very big argument with my friend the other day because they called me “racist” and “narrow-minded”. why? because i said crazy rich asians is an incredibly problematic movie. i thought it was just them but the more people i talk to, the more people it seems don’t get to see why the movie isn’t just not a hallmark of representation, instead, it’s the antithesis of it.

i want to preface this by saying that as a POC and as someone who is literally asian myself, there is nothing i love more than asian representation in popular media. and i think it should be said that i enjoyed crazy rich asians a lot as a movie. yet i have issue when people claim it as being a pioneer of representation and are quick to overlook, brush aside, and even go as far as to cover up the criticism of a lot of the movie from a racial perspective.

there are minor things that bothered me with the movie of course like the lack of other asian representation which would make sense if the movie was set somewhere else like taipei or shanghai, but instead was set in singapore, which is very ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse. or how the movie made awkwafina’s character use AAVE for comic effect and something that makes her funny, a phenomenon that has been occurring since the earliest minstrel shows from jim crow times.

however, my biggest issue with the movie isn’t that lack of representation but how that representation is rationed. there are 3 major ethnic groups in singapore: chinese, malays, and indians. chinese form roughly 75% of the population, malays 15%, and indians 10%. now the main concern isn’t that the movie sets its location in a very diverse area while only lauding and demonstrating the culture of one of its ethnic groups and setting aside the others. the movie DOES, in fact, feature malays and indians but exclusively in servantile positions. the movie is literally a celebration of a rich and wealthy majority who are constantly being serviced by the minority: minorities who, in real-life singapore, often experience discrimination, assault, and rape due to their ethnic heritage.

let me give you an analogy: say the movie was made about a rachel and nick who are both white and they go visit nick’s wealthy family. at nick’s family’s estate, it’s entirely composed of rich white people while black and hispanic people go around and serve them as maids, bodyguards, waiters, butlers, etc. i think we would all consider this to be something that’s incredibly racist. so why do people not carry that same energy for crazy rich asians? each and every person has to be casted individually. i don’t want to accuse anyone that i don’t know personally of racism directly, but it does make me curious as to why exclusively people of east asian appearance were casted as the wealthy socialites and minorities were casted as servants.

additionally, there’s a scene in the movie where before constance wu and awkwafina’s characters are about to enter the mansion and join the dinner party, they are stopped at the gate entrance and become visibly scared by the guards of the gate, who are dark-skinned, presumably indian, men with large burly figures. other than quick clips of indian servants flittering here and there, this is the only prominent presence of a dark-skinned person in the movie. the choice to depict a dark-skinned person, ones who are male and heavy-set, in a scene like this and nowhere else is incredibly racist and feeds into the centuries-old stereotype of black and brown bodies, especially black and brown men, as being scary, demeaning, servantile, and savage-like, a stereotype which has real-life ramifications against both black and hispanic people in america and indians and malays in singapore and often against foreigners and indigenous peoples throughout east asia as well.

personally, i don’t think that the people that watch and enjoy the movie are intending to be racist when they don’t see the issues with this movie, and i don’t think any of the actors are as well. i think it’s just that, for an asian-american audience, we are the ones who experience discrimination so it’s pleasing and feels rewarding to see people of our background succeeding on the big screen and also in the world of the movie. however, i don’t think a lot of us realize that american racism isn’t universal across the planet and that in asian countries like singapore, racism manifests itself in different ways and is perpetrated by and directed towards different groups than it generally is here. we all have access to the internet and the world at our fingertips, so i think we should all try to educate and better ourselves on things like this so we don’t accidentally bring other groups down or feed into existing stereotypes and racist beliefs that have real-life consequences and real-life victims even though we may not see them in our everyday lives considering they’re on the other side of the planet.

having said that, i have no issue with crazy rich asians being lauded as an incredible movie, because that’s exactly what it is. but i most definitely have a problem when it’s lauded as being an incredible movie due to its status as a “powerful example of representation”. we must all be cognizant of its glaring problematic aspects as well and realize that this movie is anything but a hallmark of representation. being someone like my friend who has become aware of these issues and continues to brush them aside like they’re minor, despite being issues that affect real people today, and continues to praise crazy rich asians as a great example of representation is racist, discriminatory, and problematic.

if you want a not problematic and, in my opinion, better movie overall which is also a step forward for asian representation in hollywood, please watch the farewell. it’s an amazing movie and i highly recommend you watch it. if you enjoyed how crazy rich asians talked about filial piety in asian cultures, the farewell has that same theme too, just without the other problematic baggage.

much love to all of u :))",30142,

12/30/2020 5:03:10,"Let's end this band x firestone controversy once and for all with this. Here I go:

To the band. I understand your willingness to play for your fellow students comes from a good place, and it's honestly a great service you're doing for this student body that's been bogged down by work and studying for the past one to two weeks. However, a service unwanted is not a service. Even if some people enjoyed your performance, that doesn't mean other people there who purely wanted a quiet space to study also should have enjoyed it. To use a metaphor, even if you have a dish made by a michelin star chef, if the person is not hungry, shoving it down their throat and telling them to enjoy it is simply an approach laced with a savior complex and a significant lack of empathy. A possible alternate choice could have been hosting an informal performance or maybe even a little bop in places like common rooms that are public spaces rather than spaces designated for quiet studying. I just hope that, in the future, you guys can act with a little more compassion for people who 1) might not have gotten the notice that you guys would be playing at firestone/are freshmen/forgot about what had happened the year before and 2) are in situations or mental states where they can appreciate your actions (and you really don't have a right to tell someone how to feel a certain way).

To the people who vocally complained about the band playing in firestone: I do think that despite you having the right to voice your complaint (and you are justified in many ways), the way you submitted a very angsty, incensed confession was a very immature way of handling the situation. We all understand - you're stressed, we're stressed. But that doesn't mean you get to suddenly lash out at fellow students who were just trying to bring you some good music (albeit with a quite inappropriate selection of time and place). Let's have some civility and level-headedness so that we don't start extra unnecessary beef in a busy time like this. 

I hope cools the heat in tiger confessions a bit - I do feel bad for TC having to be a mediator of a whole ass war here, and for both sides that have only been inflicting harm on one another in this constant back and forth. Let's all focus on our own finals (congrats to y'all humanities ppl who finished all their finals on dean's date) and support our fellow students who are all suffering in one way or another!

Peace :-)",30146,

I wonder if it's possible to get rid of this feeling of loneliness and whether I just want his attention or actually haven't moved on. We never had a formal relationship, but there was a lot of miscommunication the summer we met and I ended whatever we were because I couldn't trust him. We cleared up these misunderstandings twice now over the span of a year, not really talking in between. But he reached out recently to be good friends again and said that it was his intention to treat me well because I just went through (another) break up.

I have been in a somewhat similar-ish situation before and the advice that I was given was that if it’s taking your headspace and energy in a negative way, if it’s bringing you more confusion than peaceful answers, that it’s not worth pursuing, and you should just cut it out of your life. I didn’t follow that advice for a really long time because I thought my situation was ""different"" and that I could handle it and make it better with time and patience. I ended up getting really, really badly hurt. Turned out that I couldn’t trust him before and that had not changed at all. And they were right, the confusion wasn’t really coming from me not knowing what I wanted, it was coming from the other person playing mind games without even realizing it. Mixed and confusing signals are never a good sign. This is just my personal experience and obviously yours is going to be different and there’s not enough detail in there to really give advice on how to handle things. I would just say be careful. Sometimes things are better left in the past, even with the best intentions. ",30165,

“the fact that he's in my messages again (and is bad at responding) honestly is taking up my headspace more than I wanted”

If this situation is taking your headspace more than you want it to, it probably means it’s not the kind of energy you need in your life (/head/heart) right now. If he is trying to really be a friend like he said, he should be able to understand that and not mess with your head? Especially if you just went through a breakup. To me, the risks of having one more person confusing you when you might be feeling vulnerable outweigh the potential benefits of a friendship with someone whose intentions you're not sure about and who you couldn't even trust in the past. That's just me though, I tend to be pretty cautious with people now. ",,30165

Can we please have a more constructive conversation about these ideas? It only amplifies the silo effect and polarization if people cancel, scoff at, and/or simply lash out against these ideas. Reality is, a significant majority of Americans and others hold these views. The author is brave for standing up for them in an attempt to open up conversation.

Yes, maybe she does take some figures out of context. But doesn't everybody? It's impossible in this world to provide full context and full information always. There's also no such thing as an absolute, universal truth--we each see things differently based on our background and worldviews. Now, some people think they do have this whole truth, including Enlightened European colonizers and researchers in ivory towers...

Also, she clearly states that she is not arguing that there is no such thing as systemic racism. Here's the final paragraph:
""I am not writing to suggest that we should ignore attempts to properly uplift Black Americans given their historical suffering, especially with regard to education and poverty. Justice is due. Nonetheless, a culture of accountability and individualism should be reinforced. It is up to individuals to heal our communities. The system is imperfect, but we should direct our efforts to improving it instead of blaming it.""

What's wrong with strengthening the ""culture of accountability and individualism"" in addition to ""uplift[ing] Black Americans given their historical suffering"" and ""improving [the system]""? We can and NEED to work together.",30171,

I recently read Sierra Stern's article in the  Nassau Weekly issue ""Hats Off"". It was very well written (good job, Sierra) however it left me feeling worried about my upcoming semester on campus. I decided pretty early on in the semester that making connections online wasn't for me, and I stuck to that. I have not developed a SINGLE relationship this semester. I was living in a house where attending zoom events was difficult, and I was struggling with personal family issues and unresolved trauma that made me feel like I just needed to focus on passing my classes and feeding myself every day, however now I am moving onto campus with no friends.

It's not that I necessarily regret being anti-social this semester, I truly am not meant for making connections online. However now I have no idea how to go about making friends, especially since the social sphere will still be very limited on campus. I'm just feeling very alone, and very stressed.",30186,

I just want to start by saying I’m so sorry for your loss. This year hasn’t been easy and losing a loved one is so difficult, under any circumstances. A few months ago, the only person I ever felt comfortable sharing anything that made me remotely vulnerable with decided it was time to part ways. My entire world collapsed and I started feeling really, really lonely and unsupported in times of stress and grief. Not in a desperate way, just as a sad realization too. Once I realized that though, I made an effort to reach out to friends and coworkers and I ended up finding out that so many people had been caring about me from the sidelines without me really noticing. Honestly, there are even a couple of people I had not talked to in ages, I just texted them cold saying “hey I’m hitting rock bottom and I just need someone to talk to”. The amount of support and love I have received that way since has been overwhelming. Obviously now isn’t really the time to change everything in your life and in your ways. Grief and family come first, and if you can find some relief and peace with family, I recommend leveraging that. All that to say you’re never as alone as you think you are. I would bet anything that there are people around you who care deeply and would be happy to listen if you told them you needed to talk things out. Hang in there <3",30217,

But she is very old fashioned (has ridiculed me behind my back for not cleaning and cooking more for her son 🙃) and very scary to talk to, she does not take being disagreed with (or as she calls it, disrespected) very well at all. One day, we were all having drinks and my boyfriend asked her what I should call her because I was too scared to ask after all this time, I laughed at the time because we were tipsy and I knew he was just being lighthearted, not trying to put me in a difficult position. Anyway, she said “you may call me ___ (the word in their language for aunt)” (not telling what language bc I don’t want people to narrow down who this is). I know it’s a common practice, but it makes me uncomfortable? I can’t really explain why except that, firstly, she is not my aunt. And secondly, I don’t even call my own aunts aunt, we all just use each other’s first names. Maybe it’s because she wants me to use a close title, yet she is pretty cold and distant to me? I would just so so much rather call her Mrs. lastname, I wish I could just do that :(

I know something like this really shouldn't bother me as much as it does - especially as post graduation we can opt to identify with our OG class year - but when I see/hear all of my friends talking and getting excited about graduation, class jackets, class rings, etc., I feel kinda sad. :(

I neither notice nor care about what “gender” another person’s clothes are. However, a fundamental aspect of my psychology is preventing even the most minor deviation from established norms to avoid vulnerability. The crazy thing is I didn’t even think it was feminine when I got it, it was androgynous in my opinion. The design was cool which was really all I cared about.

I want to continue in engineering, but since I have a bunch of random interests all over the place, I'm afraid that I'll pick the ""wrong"" bse major and have to switch and restart everything. Also, like, maybe this doesn't make sense, but the things I like, the things I'm good at, and the things I want to be are different. Like, I like civil engineering and architecture, but I don't necessarily want to work as a civil engineer nor architect. I'm interested in computer science, I think being a programmer is super duper cool, and there are so many awesome jobs I would love to do with a COS degree, but I'm not confident in my programming skills at all, nor if I could make it as a computer science student, especially since there are so many people who've been coding their whole lives.

1/4/2021 5:13:36,"why is it always so standard to never receive a copy of graded final exams/never receive feedback on your final assignment? obvi not in every single class but a lot of classes in my experience. reason im asking this is bc my worst grade here was one of my final exams freshman spring (humanities class), and it was an exam i genuinely felt i did well in. this was devastating to me because i always do well on exams and the rest of my semester in that class had gone so much better than my fall semester. when i saw my final grade i wrote the professor to see what my grade breakdown was and that's how i confirmed it was that i had tanked the final--but they didnt say what exact grade i had gotten.

i had a bad relationship with that professor so i didn't push it further to see what exactly i did wrong on the exam. ive always regretted that because now i always have this weird feeling like there MUST have been some mistake or some kind of ""holistic""/curved/ranked grading (despite there being nothing said to that effect) because nothing like that had ever happened to me before or has happened since and its so frustrating. 

but all that would be obviated if everyone had just seen their graded exam. so wtf? is there a reason final exam stuff is so much in the dark? lots of other classes of mine have also not provided grades or feedback for final essays/projects, we just got to see our final grade when it was posted. i know i am definitely being bitter in relation to my situation above, but genuinely is this to give professors room to fudge grades / give what grades they think students ""deserve""? ik a lot of the time people can just ask for a copy or feedback but that seems to put too much burden on the students when it seems like for some professors its just not an expectation. is this situation normal or not normal? has anyone else thought about this?",30350,

 A person VERY dear to me had been/is going through a very tough depression episode and he had mentioned suicide several times. One night, he told me he really wanted to kill himself, and then stopped answering any sort of communication immediately for several hours. I grew ever more concerned for him and after a lot of debating myself and talking to several suicide prevention Hotline chats, I called for him to be checked on,as he lives on his own with no close friends nor family nearby and I was also not even in the country. He is now furious about this because he was not in any immediate danger, but I had no way of knowing this, as he had expressed his suicidal thoughts for several days now, and had been in a depressive episode even longer. He blocked me and he told me to not ever speak to him again, he said how I could be so stupid and condescending. I, however, feel that I came from a true place of concern and care for him, and I think I'd rather he be angry than dead.  Still, can't help but feel sad and guilty. ",30362,

1/5/2021 2:33:28,"some of the restrictions in the social contract just seem really weird or silly. for instance someone pointed out that no off-campus person can sleep over at your dorm or even visit your dorm, but you could visit/sleep somewhere off-campus. why is one of these considered safe and the other unsafe? they seem equivalently risky, so both or none of these should be allowed (i lean towards neither being allowed in this case). also, why can’t we be permitted to form small (<= 5, say and if it includes one person it must also include all their roommates and SO) pods of people with whom we are allowed to not distance? being touch-starved is a real thing and just allowing people to hug a few of their friends who are not their SO or roommate would be so so good for mental health, especially if you live in a single. you could say some people would abuse this to form bigger pods, but those same people are the ones who would ignore the rules anyways. and my proposed roommate and SO restriction on what can be a pod seems to make this relatively non-risky to the wide community. if you keep any spread within a pod whose members distance and wear masks from everyone else, you’d likely prevent an outbreak or pod-to-pod spread right? if roommates disagree on what pod they want to be in, revert to the room being it’s own pod (equivalent to current rules). obviously it’s way too late for princeton to change the rules but like in this ideal fictional world the pods should be official, like what mit did. also, it is just stupid that there will be some in-person seating in the dining halls, it should be all pick-up. why does in-person eating exist at all when there are strong restrictions on who we can see or bring into our rooms? slightly relaxing some of the distancing requirements in ways i’ve described here would not put the community more at-risk than having any significant in-person dining would. dining is potential non-mask contact between lots of people who would otherwise be distanced, if we’re gonna get an outbreak i bet it’ll be from dining.

[disclaimer: i don’t have deep knowledge on epidemiology so maybe i am being extremely stupid here. if i am i accept my own stupidity, just please don’t be mean or angry when you point it out. i am of course in favor of restrictions and protections and will abide by the rules, it’s just that a few of the rules seem silly or contradictory to me as explained (in a way that is hopefully coherent) above.]",30402,
1/5/2021 2:44:10,"re #30365:
Being on campus really won't be a very social experience. Classes and events are all going to be online, so you won't really meet people that way. Campus is also going to be less than 2/3rds populated compared to a normal year (a ton of people are taking gap years or aren't on campus), so you definitely won't be alone if you stay home. Also you can bet that there are some sociopaths that'll be hosting parties (and posting on social media about it...), so you might catch rona or help spread it to vulnerable people.

Like even the ""physical"" events that were hosted last spring for people on campus basically amount to giveaways where people showed up at a place, picked something up, and then went back to their dorms to Zoom in to the event virtually. Event organizers were really careful to make sure people didn't linger and left as soon as they got a snack or whatever. You can simulate this experience by ordering food with the money you'll save from now being on campus and attending a virtual event.",30403,

I'm not saying you shouldn't go to the men's bathroom, in fact I think most people at Princeton probably wouldn't care, but I personally have been sexually harrassed by a cis girl at a men's bathroom before Princeton (people don't really care if women go into men's bathrooms, in my experience) and I've also had multiple cis girls come into the men's bathroom at Princeton, so I would personally feel really uncomfortable, especially if it was THE bathroom I had to use daily.",30423,

1/5/2021 19:48:48,"i used to be really suicidal. i had a depressive episode that lasted around 4 months where the only things i could think about was to die. i was very closed to attempting it, but i never did, not because of the fear of dying, but because of the fear of not being able to die from the action. it was funny to me how the thing that prevented me from dying was the fear that i wasn't able to die from the suicide. but i am very glad that something kept me away from it. although i am not suicidal right now, the thought of leaving the world still crosses my mind ever so often. suppose, if i were to die today, nothing would change about anything around me, the life of my friends and family would keep going per usual, and the fact that i know nothing would change makes me feel like it is fine if i ever just decided to leave. my attitude was always like this: if i were to die, it would be fine, nothing would change anyways. this was my mentality for the majority of my life. but today, i was thinking about how much i hate myself and how much i want to die, and i asked myself, if i was given the choice to die right now, would i do it? for the first time in maybe 8 years, the answer was no. i wouldn't. there are so many things i still want to do. it has nothing to do with how other people would keep going without me, it had everything to do with me. i wouldn't because i want to keep living. and i am so proud of myself for reaching this point in my life. yes, i still think about death, but the fact that i said no to dying really changed something on the inside. thank you for reading <33",30432,
1/5/2021 20:04:15,I get terrified and become very quiet and silent when someone expresses any sort of anger at me a lot of times even to the brink of tears out of tension and anxiety. this was normal when I was in grade school and a teacher would snap at me but not when a friend got angry at me over a game (and wasn’t even that mad and told me they weren’t mad and that it’s genuinely okay). How do I help myself deal with future situations better? I typically haven’t angered many people but when it happens I wouldn’t be surprised if I become paralyzed with anxiety and guilt and insecurity. ,30433,

the AGONY of ripping off sally hansen's wax strips is accompanied by the same sound that duct tape makes when you violently wrench it from its roll. imagine a thousand bandaids being separated simultaneously from your poor, unsuspecting bikini line. and all this suffering for what??? only EIGHT (8) hairs come off at a time (if you're lucky), so you have to wax the same area at least 20 (twenty) times before you see any effect whatsoever.

Princeton is actually pretty fun, and I've had some goddamn great memories here. I have friends that I'd die for and that I'll ride with till the end of time. Even doing problem sets was such a worthwhile experience, and it kind of rocked honestly. I realize that while my negative feelings are valid and okay, that I have been totally blowing off and rudely invalidating all the great and awesome things about this place. A sense of guilt is plaguing me, since I feel awful about having badmouthed this place with every chance I get for not having a core spirit of community and for too many students suffering in silence. But at the same time, there's just too many good things about our Old Nassau for me to say that I'd be able to look anyone in the eye and say that Princeton doesn't have a special place in my heart. I have learned to be grateful today, and I think this will make a better person.

1/7/2021 13:51:19,"Some things to bear in mind for non-locals when thinking about the coup in the capital:
- this was not a surprise. I didn't see anything on my out of town friends socials until the coup actually started so I don't know how widely publicized this was beforehand but everyone local knew they were coming. Proud boys et al have been gathering for days and most of the hotels are full. we've been expecting violence for days and the police being ""unprepared"" is bs. we have large, sometimes violent crowds all the time, they have the resources to deal with this.
- they stormed the capital (fancy office with dome) not the white house (potus mansion with flat roof) 
- DC is not a state, it has a mayor not a governor and she (Mayor Bowser) does not have the same authority to act independently of the feds that state govs do. Please go read about the DC fight for statehood.
- it is unclear whether there will be another curfew tonight, but pls consider donating to one of the charities helping people commute before curfew as our Metro system (subway) is currently at reduced capacity for COVID reasons
- lastly, the capital is a building, but it is also a city and my home. it is in no way funny to write 'lol' or 'lmao' after posts about this. My city has a curfew so the independent militias (ya know terrorists) and their guns go back to their hotel down the street. we're not laughing",30526,

As someone who has done so, I think the best advice I have is: know what order you'd drop them in. 

Both because you very well might have to drop down to 6 or 5 or 4 or even 3, but also because that'll ensure you know exactly which courses you want to prioritize, so that you don't end up in the unfortunate situation of taking 6 classes and not really getting much out of any of them.

1/7/2021 18:10:08,"If Princeton didn't revoke PPK's degree when he got caught literally buying votes to stay in power, they're not gonna do it to Ted Cruz",30538,
1/7/2021 18:14:13,"Reply to 30508. I am of the opinion that a (non-honorary) degree should be revoked if and only if it is shown to have been obtained fraudulently, the student was admitted fraudulently, or the student otherwise egregiously broke the school’s code of conduct. Ted Kaczynski is a murderer and terrorist, but revoking his math PhD because of that would be silly. The Unabomber, despite his bombing, did bring new math knowledge into the world, and this should be acknowledged. We punish Kaczynski by imprisoning him for life; this and his academic career in math have nothing to do with each other. I dislike Ted Cruz as much as anyone else for his complicity in Trump’s insanity and bigotry (not to mention that he just comes across as an unlikeable prick). But essentially the same logic should apply to Cruz— his harmful actions now do not erase the fact that he (presumably) actually earned his undergraduate degree properly— so he should not have it revoked, absent evidence to the contrary. Of course, I am all for punishing Cruz in other ways, from stripping non-earned awards like one commenter suggested to voting him out or otherwise curtailing his power. I just think we should punish actions with punishments that make sense. We don’t revoke degrees for harmful use of power, and we don’t remove people from power now (solely) for fraudulently obtaining a degree years ago. It’s silly to juxtapose punishments like this.

Also, here is some more authoritative support for my claims; I believe Kaczynski is even mentioned in some of the comments: See https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/153661/what-are-the-criteria-for-degree-revocation and other linked SE Academia threads. Note that “political activities” are not a criterion for general (non-honorary) degree revocation. And though “personal misconduct” is, it is extremely hard to get this to apply in the US at least, since as pointed out in the link, the student has a property right to their degree, having paid for it (even if they pay by loans or aid, *they are the one responsible for rendering payment*, so the physical degree belongs to them).",,30538

And don't get me wrong, I'm not one to judge an entire school's faculty by one professor. However, I continue to come across similar views from other faculty members (the infamous pronoun tweet to name another example) and it's very disheartening to say the least. When I immigrated to America at a young age and dreamed about coming to Princeton because I thought it produced leaders who truly wanted to change the word for the better, I never imagined that the very professors who shape the future leaders of our country would hold such views. Guess I should have listened to other POC students when they warned me about certain aspects of Princeton.

what is this exactly? every club has a cap on the number of members it can accept, so all clubs have to submit a ranking (not strict, so ties are allowed) of sophomores in case the club reaches capacity. for sign-in clubs, these rankings are typically based on attendance at events. for bicker clubs these rankings are based on ""bicker""

why haven't we heard about this before? sign-in clubs don't often reach capacity, so the rankings don't have any effect. for example, if X has a cap of 100 sophomores and only 20 sophomores have X as their top sign-in choice, it doesn't matter how many points each of those sophomores have because they'll all be accepted

why am i bringing this up? lmao charter really wants to breed exclusivity by advertising its points-based sign-in system after it failed to go bicker, but it's really nothing special and it's a system every sign-in club already uses. no hate to charter, but i just think it's important to explain what's being waved around and to show that it's nothing new. choose the club you want to join based on experiences you enjoy, connections you make, and the people you meet, not because it's trying to appear exclusive and prestigious.",30592,

When I was about 6, my 10 year old cousin would often try to lock me in closets or sheds or rooms and many of those times he came in with me and told me he was going to tickle me but now I remember that he was playing with my nipples.

When I was about 7, my mom caught my older brother’s friend (about 11) in my room trying to play with me. He repeatedly asked me to come to his house, but I always knew I needed to ask my parents, and I also just didn’t want to.

When I was about 8, my cousin on the other side of my family, who was about 15, would lead me away to private rooms so he could play with my feet.

When I was 11, and for the first time brave enough to say anything, my second cousin who was 10, yelled out while playing tag, to tag me in the boobs. He was constantly trying to be alone with me.

Why did I forget most of this? It started with remembering one thing and now it’s all coming back and I feel so.. weird and awkward. Like there’s so many people I need to avoid. And it feels weird to make a huge deal out of it because only one of these things was actually serious. But I can’t stop thinking about it now. Is this why I started being overweight by like 14? Why I was afraid of holding hands till like two years ago, in senior year of high school?? Why I have claustrophobia??? Who else in my family thought about me like this and just didn’t act on it? I can’t imagine it’s so normal to anyone to actually reach out and touch your family member inappropriately, how were they all so brave about this? What else did I forget and will I ever remember it all?

This got way too long. I just feel so strange right now. I want some people to know even if they don’t know me. Because I am unsure if I can ever bring this up to anyone in person. It’s too weird.",30595,

1/9/2021 7:17:26,"TL;DR Can a maths major get into an econ PhD? What econ and maths courses do econ PhD programmes want? Are the political economy courses helpful and/or interesting? More specifically what is MAT322 like?

Hey folks, I'm a prospective maths soph who realised he might want to take an econ PhD in the future, and I've got a few questions.

1. Is this feasible, and if so what econ courses I should take? Ik i should be taking at least 310-311-312 but is there anything else recommended beyond that?

2. What maths courses are helpful? I did a bit of research and currently understand that I should be familiar with stats (will take ORF245), probability (either ORF309 or MAT385?), game theory (will take MAT378, which I believe should be sufficient?), and real analysis (I'm thinking of MAT322, since I heard I should be familiar with both ODE and PDE, but I don't know anybody who has taken it so any opinion on MAT322 is greatly appreciated!)

Is there any other areas of maths that I should take care of? I still want to keep a path for maths grad school open and were it not for econ-related considerations I was considering focusing my departmentals more on algebra and combinatorics and limit my analysis exposure, but I would not be too bothered by more analysis.

3. Would taking the political economy courses (POL 349, 352, 385) be helpful at all? How engaging/interesting are they? I feel like i have reasonable levels of interest in the topics of these courses per the registrar listings, but I'm not entirely sure how engaging the courses actually are and/or how helpful they would be for like econ grad school for work in the future.

1/10/2021 1:37:27,"The clock had just struck midnight, and I was holed up in my room at Princeton, lurching forward in front of my computer screen. With bated breath, I thwacked the backspace key, watching the cursor flicker and the word “Incoming” disappear in one fell swoop. Finally, I read the line aloud to myself: “Summer Analyst at Morgan Stanley.” 

FUCK YES, I shouted, taking a long sip of green tea boba to soothe the reflux residue in my throat that had built up from stress and anticipation. I lay back in my chair, letting loose my Canada goose jacket, letting the layers of clothing unfurl to expose my unkempt Charter bro tank and pillsbury doughboy bare white chest. 

As my penultimate year at Princeton drew to a close, I thought back to all the incredible moments. From those late night Macroeconomics study sessions with Gunnar and Xavier, to that night I took Stacy Macmillan to the first dance at Charter, or when I wrecked Ninja on his own Fortnite stream (fucking GG), I was world class at everything I had attempted in the last three years. Getting into Princeton is one thing—but now, it was safe to say that I had truly achieved new heights. I was on the path to greatness.

""Greatness,"" I whispered, turning to look at the Kanye poster hung up above my bed. If three years at Woody Woo had prepared me for something, it was this moment. 

All of a sudden, Siri let out an audible squeal as my phone was hit by a flurry of messages. I slipped out of my chair and made a grab for it. 

ARJUN:
“hey man”
“yo”
“think u can read my essays”
“pls”

You see, most of my friends had stopped going on CollegeConfidential.com by second semester senior year. Arjun, however, was an anomaly. He was a junior in college now, and for the last 7 years he had made fruitful congress with the website. 

Make no mistake—just like you, me, and these other Woody Woo fuckers who might be especially chary to admit it, Stanford had been his dream school from the beginning. But when the time finally came to turn in The Common App, he suddenly went soft and applied ED to Cornell.

But Cornell was a mediocre suitor, and Arjun was making his debut. At first, he did what he could. Whether it was attending Hack Harvard so he could have Harvard show up somewhere on his CV when Twitter recruiters ran some scripts it, or studying abroad at Oxford for one 10-week term, he made every effort to draw the eye of the reader away from the disfiguring blemish, the college residing in the home of Odysseus, the shitstain that distorted his otherwise passable LinkedIn profile.

To no avail, Arjun attempted to write transfer app after transfer app. He ran experiments. A/B tested. But like a private repository on Github, the machinations of the college admissions process were impenetrable to him.

He needed a battle-tested expert with years of relevant experience. He needed me. 

“lol. $1000 for every app I provide feedback on,” I shot back.

“Bro you and I both know that’s unreasonable”
“and all my apps are pretty much done at this point, I just need a quick sanity check”

“Alright $300. But you pay first”
“my Venmo is @AlphaQuail”

“Kk fine”

He sent me his Common App login and I opened the page that contained all the fruits of his labor. I hovered my cursor over a button and I paused for a second to consider the implications of what I was about to do. This could be fatal. But it was necessary.

I pressed the trash button.

There was no racket, just the faint hum of my 15 inch MacBook as memory was wiped away in some digital palimpsest far away. 

It took a while for the dust to settle. 

“Bro wtf? My college apps disappeared”
“DUDE?“
“WTF YOU DELETED THEM???”

I penned my final reply:

“To be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ to get into Princeton lol”

And blocked him.

I thought back to all the hours I had labored in Stokes after hours. I was on the path to greatness, and there were going to be casualties. Necessary ones. I thought back to that one Blackstone MD I had reached out to as a freshman and the advice he had imparted: “It is not enough to succeed, Jason—others must fail.”

“It is not enough to succeed, others must fail,” I repeated.

""Greatness,"" I mumbled, turning to look at the Kanye poster above my bed once again.",30627,
1/10/2021 2:33:11,"I stay home as I should and I enjoy time at home but I can’t help but feel lonely and down at times. I feel fine, but I especially notice the difference when I see friends outside about once a month or two and my attitude brightens up. I know my friends meet all the time to hang out, go to the city, and have sleepovers, doing risky things while thinking they are taking sufficient precautions. I’ve held up and stayed home for 7 months or so now, except for seeing people  outside here and there with gaps anywhere from 3 weeks to 2 months in between. But it gets harder and harder every day to feel as though my efforts will pay off. It gets harder to feel hope for if and when this will end and I wonder if there really will come a day when I feel the pay off and feel grateful that I held out for so long. I hope that people stay home and set better examples during a time when we should follow the expected behavior in order to encourage each other to do so as well. I hope that all the scary strings and variants including in other countries can be managed even though it seems so impossible. I hope that we will have less deaths and more health because people are getting more and more complacent as things get worse and worse. Getting covid and facing the consequences can happen in an instant: just because we haven’t gotten it yet doesn’t mean we won’t. Even if it’s asymptomatic, I can’t imagine the regret of wishing you were more careful. Of wishing you hadn’t gone that night. Of fearing you gave it to someone else. Of fearing you’ll give it to your parents and fearing it’ll take a toll on their health. I hope people think unselfishly for this semester on campus. I hope we can follow guidelines and start strong and remind ourselves of consequences because everyone needs to play their part in ensuring the health of our community. There’s many ways that we can work together to keep our mental health and social live in tact without putting our physical health at risk. It’ll be weird and socially awkward for sure, but this is just how things are now and nothing is worth it more than your health :) You might never know how important a healthy body is until you’re confronted with the real fear of not having it any more. And you know what, masks are kind of great! no need to worry about if your looking a little tired or you got a pimple on your nose. Maybe it’ll keep your face warm on cold days?

when you travel to campus, there is always some risk that if you’re contagious when traveling, you’ll pass it on to other travelers. or you could even pass it on to someone else on move in day if you’re not being especially careful! so if you quarantine as much as is possible in your situation now, you’re going to be making travel safer. yes quarantining sucks especially in your last days at home (or wherever you are) but it’s a sacrifice worth making if you want to return to campus and minimize the risk.",30661,

My family and I are close, however, arguably, an unconventional kind of close... a closeness, although not exactly transparent, that is loving, understanding, and ever-present. Our family's closeness... it's not defined by the details we disclose, but the bond that is comprised of humor, attitude, and love for each other. We may be linked intellectually, but that need not be strictly compensational connection. It is mutually understood that we all have a deep love for each other... marked by certain memories that will last in our minds and hearts, til it is time to pass. I love my family, forever.""

""Sometimes people get confused why I go home just to chill out in the family room while my parents work in their respective corners in silence, my siblings in their rooms. And I get upset having to defend the way I feel the most content spending time with my family, working in comfortable silence knowing they're within arms reach. It's fine that I don't spend every moment in conversation, digging to find out everything that's going on. Not everyone works like that. It certainly doesn't mean I love them any less. I found one of [Our dead sister]'s old journals from 2014, and came across this. I'm glad we were on the same page. I miss her""
--
I can go months without even thinking about how my sister's death affected each one of us in my family. I mean it's been years. But once in a blue moon, I see shit like this and I just break down crying in my room while packing to go to school. A life growing up being embarrassed by my family's antics when I just wanted to exist in the background, this type of love is definitely true for me. A quiet love, that is almost never outwardly expressed yet is implied. But looking back I still feel like a fool not spending more time with her, not taking family photos seriously, or just doing my own thing while she was dying downstairs. 

I've always been so jealous of my friends who can love their family openly, unashamed. I understand I'm in a fortunate position to even have a family that will love me unconditionally, but I still can't get the words ""I love you"" out of my mouth to my parents even when I know I won't be seeing them for months, or to her when we won't talk again for the rest of my time being alive. I leave my sisters on delivered, and keep the important details of my life from them. I've come to accept this is just how my family operates, but is this the type of family dynamic I would want to create when I have my own? I dunno. ",30685,

I tried to act tough, did sports because I was athletic, not because I had any actual desire to tackle someone. I hated the locker room, and I hated acting like I belonged. I fooled them, I think. But because I was trying so hard to not be labeled as someone I am not, I somehow became even more distant from who I really was. I really hurt her, and it's so stupid.

1/13/2021 4:37:41,"Hi friends! Here is my queue of miscellaneous grudges I'm holding against admin at the moment. Numbers for organization, and not a relative ordering of how angry I am by each thing or each thing's importance (though 2, 1, and 5 in that order make my blood boil the most). Join me in calling for admin's heads unless they change this stuff.

1. Removing fall and spring break and failing to take any measures that would actually give us a break even for 2 days. All they have to do is require all the faculty to give no work over break and to not reschedule classes or anything; it's inexcusable that they didn't.

2. Absolutely unreasonable, draconian, and cruel punishments from the honor committee without any evidence for things that don't even break the honor code.

3. Barring use of laundry until after general arrival quarantine is over, which forces students who are unable to obtain enough clothes to be stinky and unsanitary. Not to mention that the laundry rush on 2/1 will result in lots of close contact between groups of people.

4. Being unreasonable about the exact times of arrival for students who cannot obtain reasonably priced flights for the exact time they were scheduled for. Even preventing people from coming to campus because a flight got cancelled, or just generally being unreasonable, stupid, inefficient, and stubborn for dumb bureaucratic reasons.

5. Not making any special, concerted effort to care for students' mental health and well-being in this virtual semester. We just get told that CPS exists as always, but there wasn't any reduction in work or even perfunctory effort at providing extraordinary resources for the extraordinary circumstances. The cheesy, useless ""Live well, Be well"" emails don't count.

6. Forcing us to get up before 10 AM every day to submit our COVID test. This is just stupid and terribly screws up my sleep schedule, and besides how in the world does it matter when during the day I submit my test as long as it's soon enough for them to send me the result before they close (and submitting in the early afternoon seems like it'd give them enough time)?

7. Anything I forgot or newly think of.

In general, admin's actions lately have shown me that they don't actually care about students' well-being, or at best, if they do care, they do a pretty sucky job of showing it. Finally here is a disclaimer that we're all incredibly privileged to go to Princeton, and so many other schools did a job orders of magnitudes worse than what Princeton's done, but that doesn't mean Princeton has done a good job or that their failures aren't worth complaining vociferously about.",30759,

Especially when it feels like everyday, I am still bombarded my thoughts of self harm and suicide, even if I am safe in the sense that I can limit the possibilities of doing these things, I just feel so awful about my life, like I cannot possibly keep shouldering this burden, like it will get to much to manage all these thoughts. My friends are so lovely and supportive but my brain is a horrid place and makes it hard to feel good about anything or even hope that things will change or get easier. I just think things will keep getting worse, until I can't do it anymore.",30820,

Once, a close friend of mine, who might have had a crush on me (I don’t really know if they did), just completely stopped messaging, responding to, or even reading my texts. It was saddening, hurtful, and scary, when I had no idea if I had done anything that hurt them, if something happened to them, etc. To this day, I have no idea why my friend just disappeared from my life. Obviously, you can choose to not talk to someone for any or no reason, you don’t ever owe it to them to respond. But it would be a kindness, and could avert a lot of unnecessary hurt and sadness assuming they care about you, if you respond by just telling them what you wrote here in your post.

1. Make sure you are well hydrated when you're trying to administer the test. It should be obvious but it's easy to forget to drink water. 

2. Another way to release saliva is to  roll your tongue around in your mouth and touch the inside of your cheeks and the parts in front of your teeth. It's a very effective trick to produce saliva. 

3. They will tell you that you need the saliva to be liquid and up to a certain point in the tube. Note that when the saliva is originally foam/bubbles it can take some time for it to liquefy. You'll eventually get the hang  of when to stop spitting and let the bubbles do their trick. 

Happy spitting.     ",30833,

I can force myself to do it a certain amount of times per week when I absolutely have to - I’m getting through life somehow - but it simply isn’t sustainable for me to do every day of every week for 12 weeks straight. Obviously it’s not their responsibility to change the whole system for me so I’ll just have to adapt somehow.

I also remember reading in one of the billion and a half emails that our prox cards will be granted access to buildings and other facilities on an individual basis depending on our quarantine status, so it would make sense that laundry is the same way.

So the study referred to in the video was designed to find a cheap and effective way to test masks for manufacturers. The results were misrepresented in the media saying because they counted more and smaller droplets when wearing a gaiter than no mask at all, which the authors speculated could make COVID more transmissible. The media took hold of that speculative statement and started reporting it, falsely, as fact. The study was not designed to study transmissibility differences, just to study how the masks could be tested. 
There have been multiple studies since about the efficacy in multiple types of face covering in protecting from COVID-19, in which they have often found similar efficacy between single layer gaiters and face masks as well as better efficacy with double layer face masks. Here are two such studies:

https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/08/neck-gaiters
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-those-bogus-reports-on-ineffective-neck-gaiters-got-started/

So please, in the future, do not get your scientific information purely from youtube videos or at least do some basic research on what you find. This rhetoric is extremely unhelpful and unproductive. We want to be encouraging people to do their part and wear face coverings not vilifying them on their type of covering, based on poorly researched and incorrect information. ",30908,

1/17/2021 10:33:12,"PSA to all international students flying to the US:

I flew in to JFK airport yesterday (Jan 16) and I had the most hostile encounter with the border officers. This is my 3rd time entering the US on my student visa, and the first two were pretty standard: line up for about an hour, answer a couple questions like what's your school, where is it, what are you studying, and I'm free to grab my luggage and head out. This time was different.

After the standard questions, there was an ""Are you taking classes online or in-person?"" and I said ""Entirely online"", because returning students can take an entirely online courseload and enter the US according to current regulations. The officer said I need to do some ""administrative checking"", kept my passport & I-20, and I was taken to an inner room where no phone use was allowed (so I couldn't let my partner waiting outside to pick me up know that I'm taken in). In the room was... every other international student on the flight. I was there waiting for about 2 hours (this was on top of the 24 hours journey I just had). Each of us had to wait for our turn and go up, and answer a bunch of increasingly hostile questions. Mine were:

* Where are you going to school?
* What are you studying? (I'm undeclared, so on my I-20 it says ""Liberal arts"" and that was what he wanted to hear. I also said that unofficially I'm doing computer science)
* Where's your school?
* Are you doing classes online or in-person? (I said online, but Princeton invited all undergrads back. He didn't care about that)
* Where are you staying? Like in an apartment, dorms...? (I said on-campus, in a dorm)
* Why don't you take any in-person classes? (I said there aren't any computer science classes in person)
* Then why are you entering the US? (I said because timezones were causing me to struggle with classes, my grades dropped, I couldn't participate in extracurriculars)
* Why don't you just stay awake when your friends are? (I said I did, I went to bed at 8AM, woke up at 4PM, saw no sunlight, couldn't go for walks because my area isn't safe at night, my mental health plummeted)
* *sarcastically* Computer science seems like a very difficult major to do entirely online, huh? (I said I concentrate in tech ethics, etc, it has a humanities component to it so I need more human interactions and discussions)
I basically was about to break down and cry in front of him (which would've been a bad look) when he stopped questioning me. Other students were also asked things like: (If they have an OPT internship this summer) Where are you interning? Are you paid? How much are you paid? What do your parents do? And more that I forgot. We were all provided entry, no one was detained from our flight, but it was so stressful for all of us, I could see it on everyone's faces.

So like, this is a heads up for all of you coming in, please be prepared. Bring all your documents and have them in order. Print your transcript, financial aid letter, any additional financial documents, write down your DSO and PSAFE phone number for tougher challenges, and just be really prepared to justify why you're coming in, and realize that it might take much longer than usual. I talked to a couple international friends at other schools who also had a similar experience. Good luck guys, and stay strong.

1/17/2021 15:56:52,"Observation: TC# has had lots of posts that were misinformation, or at least misleading, lately. Examples:
1. The neck gaither post, which as one commenter pointed out was inflammatory and neglected to mention that a 2-layered gaither is effective according to the CDC.
2. The laundry posts, though those posts becoming misinformed is the fault of the university’s unclear, self-contradictory, and seemingly constantly changing quarantine laundry policy.
3. The post saying that the honor code suspension rate is insanely high, when in fact— as commenters mentioned— reading the report shows 20% are found guilty then 60% of those found guilty were suspended. Those numbers don’t seem absurdly high to me. (To be clear, the honor committee— which doesn’t have complete control over the punishments— is draconian and enables cruelty and power-tripping with no apparent benefit of existing. But the suspension rate alone isn’t indicative of these problems.)
So y’all— and this includes me too because I’ve hastily made wrong comments before—, just be really careful when you make a post about some university policy or other piece of info. At least do a nominal Google search or search of university web pages before sending in your post. These 3 instances of misinformation I pointed out above are harmless so far, but misinformation is bad, and maybe worse misinformation will be spread in the future. Also, big props to commenters who kindly, civilly correct factually wrong posts! Y’all are super helpful. Finally I just wanna make clear that this isn’t Tyga’s fault at all, you’ve already put so so much work into this page and it’s unreasonable to expect you to research any submitted post about factual matters. I’m not accusing you of spreading misinformation, it’s the fault of the people who submitted incorrect posts (or of the university for changing policies), not your fault.

1/17/2021 23:22:07,"Alright, this is something I've needed to confess on here for a long, LONG time. You may remember a confession a long time ago about someone who was moving their beds in their room at the beginning of last year. This actually might have been in a previous iteration of TC. Basically, when they turned their bed on its side, in a small crevice in the bed, a bunch of clipped nails fell out.

I need to confess to that OP. I did it. It was me. When I saw your confession I literally (not literally) shat myself in humiliation and shame and regret.

I was a disgusting and gross human being for doing that. I want you to know, OP, that I am truly, truly sorry for my lazy ass that year that I did that. Every *single* time I clip my nails near my bed I have thought of the guilt of doing that and it has haunted me to this day knowing you had to deal with that. Your confession seriously caused me to stop doing this and actually throwing them away like a damn normal human being. I wish I could send you a small gift to show how sorry I am. I'm too much of a bitch to ever own up to it in person even if you revealed who you are, but maybe I could try to find a way to anonymously give you something as a way to make up for it. 

I generally think and thought of myself as a clean person, but that was the exception. Never again will it happen. OP, I hope you can accept my anonymous apology. If you happen to be out there and comment in response, maybe I can try to find a way to make it up to you.

If it's any consolation, OP, it's probably true that many Princeton students during the normal process of wear and tear of their bed get sexual fluids in the room, on surfaces, etc., that might not just be contained on their sheets, e.g. seeping through thin sheets on the mattress etc, or vomit beer or alcohol up on their floor and never truly clean it up because facilities doesn't come until it's a bit too late. Well, OP, I want you to know your room was free of that, because I never once drank in my room and I certainly wasn't having sex then. So, hopefully, if that incident haunts you to this day still, you can look back knowing that I did nothing else to defile the bed or room with any other bodily fluids, even as other princeton students might have done the same.",30957,

1/18/2021 0:12:46,"This is super toxic and probably my first true ""confession"" for this page but here goes:
I'm a senior and I have been struggling with the decision to go back to campus (going back this week)- I sort of hope the university decides to send us back home at the halfway mark again (with much better options for emergency housing for people that need it / accept way more ppl for emergency housing) so that I can go home without guilt and FOMO. That is so selfish and toxic but it is my deep shameful secret I guess.
Graduation in-person would be great but it is a dream I have long ago given up on, so I just want a couple memories with my roommates and then go home and do my thesis for real in an environment I low-key much prefer. 
And don't recommend I just don't move in because FOMO gets me way more depressed than S.A.D. I think. Honestly the best case would've been that we come back to campus AFTER ""spring break"" because we'd be further from flu season and also further from the depths of depressing winter hell

Anyway those are my deep shameful desires and I'm really sorry it's so selfish. Why am I so childish that FOMO is playing a role in my decisions...In a pandemic,?!?;  I'll just go ahead and cancel myself for y'all buh bye",30961,

1. A modular home is a home that is built on the northern half of the Great Plains, and complex numbers live inside it. Every modular home has two important values, its level and weight. The level is just how many levels (stories) the home has, and the weight is how much it weighs, just like you'd expect. Note that if you want to build a modular home that weighs an odd number of pounds, it will collapse if it's only one level tall.

Former HC member here. In no way am I trying to evoke sympathy for myself or be defensive about my involvement with the Committee with any of the following responses.

1) The Honor Constitution (https://honor.princeton.edu/constitution) technically gives the HC quite a bit of latitude in the penalties it can assign. This is especially true after the most recent referenda that got rid of the one-year suspension standard penalty and introduced disciplinary probation of various degrees (no longer is the only option probation until graduation – the HC can set the length now) and the one semester suspension (though for the time being this will likely result in a one year separation from the university, with one semester technically a leave of absence, since it is almost impossible to take just one semester off without advanced standing) as possible penalties for a first Honor Code violation, in addition to a one, two, or three year suspension. The only check on the penalty recommended by the Committee is from the Dean of the College (who handles the appeals) and the President (who has final say). However, they can only lower the penalty recommended by the HC, not increase it. 

2) To be honest, I’m still wrestling with this one myself. Of course, academic integrity is important, and the University should have rules against cheating, but I think the end that the University seeks would be much better served by a restorative justice approach rather than a punitive one. However, I am inclined to think that despite all its faults, the students on the Committee are more likely to be able to empathize with their peers that come before them and render a more appropriate penalty than the administration would (especially in light of their resistance to changing the Honor System to begin with). Of course, I’d like to see significant structural changes, but this is one redeeming quality of what we have now that I think there is some truth to.

3) Looking back, such reports, while disheartening, are not entirely surprising. I know that I would be traumatized if I had to go through the process myself (especially if my case made it to hearing). To address the core of your question concerning leniency, the votes simply aren’t there (or at least they weren’t when I was there). The vast majority of the members thought that some form of suspension was the appropriate starting place for most violations (excluding overtime violations). By suggesting that we start at probation, I was in a very small minority.

4) I left the Committee when I concluded that there was nothing I could really do to make it any better. I was glad to have had somewhat of a hand in the reform measures that the admin eventually allowed to pass, but they did not go far enough imo. Likewise, I eventually came to believe that rather than helping my peers navigate a difficult disciplinary process by ensuring its fairness (my intention when I joined), I was really just acting as a cog in an unjust machine.

5) I actually joined the HC after the admin struck down the referenda (and after voting for them myself). Ever the idealist, I figured that if this is the system that we were going to have, I would rather have someone like myself on the Committee (someone who generally tries to do the right thing and was concerned with the equitable treatment of my peers) than someone else I didn’t know (perhaps someone who matched the evil caricature often ascribed to members of the Committee – which after joining I found to be very inaccurate. I believe other Committee members were and are good people trying to do what they think is right). I also thought that perhaps I could help “change it from the inside.” But as I said before, I eventually just couldn’t take it anymore and concluded I was doing far more harm than good.

6) I was never comfortable with it. I was quite upset after my first hearing and often lost sleep before and after subsequent hearings. The thought that I could have a part in suspending someone who was totally innocent or imposing a penalty that I thought was too harsh had a great effect on me. The only way I could justify it to myself was like I said above: better it is me, whose judgement I trust, rather than someone else who might not take this as seriously as I do. But again, this could only sustain me for so long and eventually I could no longer justify my involvement to myself.

I hope this was somewhat illuminating to OP of #30934 and others.",31113,

Honestly, therapy. Therapy and lots of time. and it still kind of sucked but I had a couple of very solid friends and a supportive family who helped me through it. And several therapists. I really cannot understate how crucial is was for me to speak to someone completely removed from the picture (especially because this abuser was friends with a lot of administration as well so going to my DSL was difficult), and being able to tell them how badly I was struggling with this abuser still being seen as a good and fun person despite their actions towards me. I don’t think I ever found forgiveness for them, but I found acceptance that the way they treated me was NOT okay and it was NOT my fault in any way. I worked with a trauma therapist who helped me revisit the trauma safely and try to rethink my feelings towards it (ex. going from thinking “I deserved to be hurt” to “I am worthy of love and compassion even if I wasn’t shown it here”). To be able to look at the past and say “that was really messed up, but it no longer defines me and I have control of my life now” was incredibly freeing. I used to cry at even the thought of them, but soon I was to be able to tell my friends “this was traumatic, I’m not comfortable doing/going to (xyz) yet, let’s do something else” and realizing I don’t owe anybody an explanation of the details of my trauma. The first time I saw them again was difficult, but I kept pushing myself to do what I want on campus because this campus is MINE as much as it is theirs, and I refused to let this person take any more of my joy. It took so much time (and again, therapy) but I am glad I pushed through, even if a lot of days were really hard and dark.

1/21/2021 10:32:49,"My First Confession

This is gonna be saucy. On the 18th, I moved into my single with a shared bathroom. Later that afternoon my neighbor moved in. I'm a super anxious person who was worried about sharing a bathroom with a complete stranger so like any sane person I left a note on the door. In it, I introduced myself and asked if they wanted to talk so we could get to know each other after phase one of quarantine, after all, we’re practically roommates. When I woke up the next morning there was a note slipped under the adjoining door written in the cutest handwriting I had ever seen. A person's handwriting says a lot about them. When I picked up the note, I felt a connection forming in my heart. I don't know if it was the hearts dotting the I's or the perfect swirly L's that got my heart hooked. The note was short and sweet. It said, ""I'd love to chat. Let’s have lunch in our shared hallway at 1. XOXO"". I remember it was the ""XOXO"" that got me. The note was all I could think about, I just wanted 1 to come. It was taking too long, time was moving too slowly. I decided to take a nap.

I think I fell asleep around 10ish but I can't be sure. A bit about myself: I'm a bit of a nudist when I'm alone, it helps me feel free. Naturally, since I was alone, and I felt safe I took my nap. Naked. It took forever for me to fall asleep, honestly, I spent most of my time fantasizing about the note, so much time in fact that I forgot to set my alarm.

I overslept. I woke up to a light knocking on my door. Disoriented I got out of bed and reached for the doorknob and opened the door. I was still a little tired. After rubbing my eyes I saw her. Due to both the light in the hallway and my room being off, her face was in silhouette. The light from her room bounced off her supple bronze skin and into my eyes. I swerve there was music playing in the background. She reached for the light. In anticipation, I covered my eyes. Opening them felt like a camera flash from one of those old cameras where the flash mechanism is bigger than the actual camera. Her bronze face lightened up to a lighter brown, and her cheeks to a rose gold. She was staring at me with an intensity I had never seen before. I followed her eyes to see what she was looking at. Her eyes hit the center of me and before I could even process what was happening the temperature rose 10 degrees. I was naked. I was NAKED. Time was at a standstill. I was frozen in place. I had no idea what to do. After what felt like an eternity I darted behind the cover of my door and shut it. I yelled I'm sorry.

As I was putting my clothes on I heard it again. A shy knock on my door. I panicked, slipped my shoes on, and ran outside to get lunch. It’s been a couple of hours. I haven't talked to her since. I was thinking of writing another note but I'm not sure. What do I do? I’m freaking out.",31125,

1/21/2021 14:12:35,"('24 here) Now that I'm starting to actually meet people on campus, I'm realizing that my social battery is like SO bad.  I feel like people think I'm being rude and yea part of me does want to hang out with people and get to know them (within the rules ofc) but whenever I try, my social energy plummets within minutes.  I'm an introvert who is very comfortable being alone and having just a few friends, so it's really overwhelming coming from almost a year of getting comfortable barely leaving my house to suddenly running into someone new every day who wants to hang out.  I don't want people to think I'm rude but it's hard af to make myself say yes to things when there's a very real possibility that I'll have absolutely nothing to say after five minutes of hanging out with even a good friend.  Sooner or later I know I'm going to have to force myself to hang out with people.  Is this a common thing?  Part of the quarantine blues perhaps?  Maybe I'm just more comfortable being alone?  Anyways, in the same vein: it's even harder to explain to someone that you don't want to hang out with them because you know they haven't been following the rules / hanging out would be breaking the rules.  Like really I just don't want to get corona/sent home/the campus shut down, I don't think it's that hard to not meet in large groups or go on four walks in a day with 15 different people when we're only supposed to take one????

One advice from my therapist that really helped me was, every time I’m reminded of them or the incident, to consciously remind myself of how much I’ve grown and learned from it and came out of the other end a stronger, more mature and empathetic person. This reframing really helped me move forward and not let them or the incident make me feel so anxious or low anymore.
Also, once you feel safer, try not to avoid every place or event just because they might be there. Time away to heal is definitely important, but I made the mistake of avoiding every social event and place where I might bump into them and in return spent too much time alone.

Most people seem to think that you should first talk to whoever is violating these rules before reporting them. Ignoring the fact that I might not have their contact info or feel uncomfortable yelling at strangers, I'm just curious, if you see someone who violates the Honor Code, do you report them or tell them not to do it again then just let them gain an unfair advantage and disadvantage yourself? I agree with the whole argument about second chances, but it's the university's job to give out second chances, not me. For example, if someone transmitted COVID or got COVID due to participation in prohibited social gathering, I do believe they should get second chances to amend their mistakes, only after facing their punishments. I really don't think they should walk away without any consequences, because they already brought irreversible harm to the campus community.",,31157

I don't want to say this publicly, because I can't have public arguing to weaken rules associated to myself. But the technicalities of the rules don't matter because you! fucking! need! to! eat! It's absolutely not okay that they're refusing to feed you! Go get food in a way that is as safe as possible, even if it breaks the rules, by walking (with masks and distance) to Nassau Street at an odd hour and to a less popular place (not Tacoria) to avoid big crowds. You should act as safely as you possibly can, because this really is super important, but feeding yourself is more important than following the exact letter of every rule. Get food, but don't go to Tacoria during lunch rush. However, if you can feed yourself while staying within the rules, that would be even better! I have a couple ideas on this end: If you know anyone who's done with arrival quarantine, ask them to get some food from Nassau street for you, or ask your neighbors to talk to the dining staff on your behalf when they pickup meals. (In my experience the staff are *extremely* nice, and I bet they'll do everything they can to help you!) Finally, see if you can have it in writing (and SAVE ALL YOUR EMAILS ABOUT THIS) that they are refusing to feed you. This is actually outrageous, and, if you can get proof in writing, nuclear options involving words like ""lawyer"" and ""public shaming on social media"" seem very appropriate.

things are complicated
this seems an obvious fact
but not one actively applied
eating, for example

we think of things as going in and going out
the period between just being storage
but its process is less static than we actively consider
our nourishment takes a long journey to sustain us'

this makes certain notions possible
the dessert stomach, as one says, is the same as regular
but with dinner just being given more time to travel
though even meal distinction isn't necessary

the natural consequence of an all you can eat buffet
where waste as profit is beyond your wildest dreams
work to dethrone the mountain of your own creation
the solution to your own creation is simple

""two eatings, one sitting""

tupperware is nice, but we don't all have a fridge
our bodies can make space, in more ways than one
it is not consuming, then digesting
but everything at once, in tandem

I’d understand if I ordered last minute but I gave more than one week of leeway and I’m still not gonna have some crucial items needed for the semester. I also acknowledge that the staff seems to be working hard and they are usually fairly friendly, and maybe this situation is just an enormous logistical nightmare on the scale of 1 week+ package delays and there’s nothing more they can do about it.

I wanted to write this in a sincere sense of gratitude, on behalf of all whom are on Tiger Confessions. Your dedication to responding to all these posts, and how sincerely you want to befriend people on this page, truly shines. You bring a light to this page, which eradicates, in part, the darkness in our readers' lives. I know many people who write on here have an impact, but I can say without a shadow of doubt, that you have made so many people, whom you have never met, smile day in and day out. I cannot thank you enough for how much you look after peoples' best interests on this page. Your comedic timing and eccentricities are of course a pleasure, and make me laugh for countless hours at a stretch, but it's your desire to make this page a better place which really touches me. I really hope that people take you up on your offer for daily walks, as I do believe it will create a pathway for carving a change in their lives for the better. I have no idea what you are doing right now, and what you may be thinking, but all I can hope is that you have a great day, for now and forever.

1/30/2021 16:28:44,"@ 31605: So this is probably not applicable for everyone and might not apply to that person specifically, but I’ve experienced quite a bit of stress and mental health struggles in the past few years (like a lot of people tbh). It’s important to remember that those things affect everyone differently, and everyone has different ways of coping. There’s honestly some times where I just want to be alone, have some quiet time all by myself to decompress and process my feelings. I don’t feel lonely, I just want to chill with my own thoughts. It’s not always easy to say to someone “hey i’m kind of struggling psychologically right now and I just need some space for myself/don’t really want to hang out”. So often I’ll just say that i have work to do or something like that. It doesn’t have anything to do with me not liking the other person or not wanting to spend time with them at all. It’s just that it’s easier to not have to explain, or start a conversation about my mental health every time. Anyways like I said, it might be different for everyone. Some people also want to chill by themselves without necessarily dealing with stress or mental health and they shouldn’t really have to explain themselves either. I wouldn’t really take it personally. ",31655,

1/31/2021 19:52:45,"so this is awk and embarrassing and might be a bad idea to post here but im here anyways. so last week someone expressed how they did not want to meet someone because their SO followed trump and so they assumed they were trump supporters. ive seen this type of judgement in the past and personally i make the same conclusions sometimes. my bf happens to follow trump although he claims to not support him and i genuinely believe he does not have any bad intentions but i told him how this makes me worry that others will jump to conclusions and i dont understand the need to follow the account especially now. in this day and age it’s easy to assume that he supports him since he follows and like that first convo, someone will make assumptions about me, a sexy liberal chick. this keeps leading to arguments because he is stubborn about unfollowing and i just don’t understand why. he says he doesnt care and why would ppl make assumptions but that’s just how it is and i don’t understand why he cant just unfollow. what is he getting out of it right now? i feel stupid to be arguing over this but it just worries me that maybe he’s just lying about his political stance or ppl are just gonna think he’s a horrible person and judge us both.

1/31/2021 21:33:04,"I'm OP of #31647. The reason I didn't post this as a comment is that I'm a middle class student, and I realized that my post could come across as ignorant to less fortunate students. I was afraid to be judged, and I'll admit that. Sorry. I'm just pissed that I need to pay close to full tuition for Princeton and my family also has to financially support a shit ton of other family members in a foreign country, which isn't considered when Princeton calculates financial aid. On the other hand, some students straight up don't have to pay tuition even though they probably end up making the same amount of income as my family does after giving a ton of it away to dozens of family members. Also, my family is extremely frugal despite not being low-income. That's why I find it so difficult to understand why some students can't just take out loans, work, and pay for FOOD, which is a basic necessity. I know ""just take out loans"" sounds harsh, but when you can't eat enough every day (again, basic necessity), I feel like loans would be worth it. Again, sorry. I'm coming at this from a standpoint where my family just saves and saves and saves and literally never spends on anything other than food, utilities, school, and clothes, and I guess I'm just critical of anyone who chooses to spend their money on anything else. That's probably a me issue. It's just that for me, health is wealth, and personally I will do anything I can do to eat a healthy amount every day and live as comfortable as possible. Lastly, to respond to those who addressed the tutoring suggestion. Don't tell me you wouldn't tutor for moral reasons if you were literally starving like this person. Also, you don't need connections? Wyzant exists? Again, I realize this might be coming from my unusual financial circumstances and mentality about money, so sorry if I'm hurting anyone's feelings or being insensitive. My original post came from a position of frustration, sadness, and sympathy. This mix obviously came off as insensitive. So I'll apologize once more.",31728,

You start breathing more quickly as you realize that you will no longer be a virgin in a few minutes. She struggles to unbuckle your belt, so you quickly slide it off, and then stand up and pull your pants and shirt off. You stare at her cleavage as she stares at the tip of your penis sticking out of your boxers. Your thoughts slow to a crawl as you feel your arms begin to grab her waist and pull her ass toward you. Pulling her yoga pants down to her knees, you realize that you’ve released a bit of precum onto the couch. Fuck me, she says, now shirtless. You look at the side of her breast as you roll a condom onto your penis, surprised by how cold it is. Your heart begins to beat through your entire body, your groin becomes furiously warm, and the tip of your penis gets its first taste of pussy. Her vagina wraps slowly around your dick, welcoming its presence. In and out, slowly. Your thighs try to hug each other from afar as you push all you can into her behind, leaving no room for doubt. A wave of nauseating pleasure pours through your forehead as you begin to cum.

They won’t agree to things like meeting up in smaller groups or on walks. I’ve just been not showing up but I can’t help but feel a little left out.

Even though enforcement would be hard/impossible, it's more about the spirit of the laws here. The virus doesn't go away because you're h*rny! Why have these inconsistencies in the social contract?

my heart is like a cheese fondue—
a melty warmth of flavors
ripe with age and lessons learned

mixing and sighing and bubbling
with affection,
clinging to those who dip their
forks into it and
pulling with the resistance of 
preemptive forlornness,
stretching out like a long taffy
until you
break away.

it shrinks back into itself,
stewing some more but then

letting you continue dipping into
my love

even though i know
you’ll pull your fork out
and take your bread with you

still cocooned in 
remnants of the
bath of gooey gouda and swiss
that i drew for you
before you got home—
now growing colder.

I've struggled with really violent thoughts all my life. Seriously hurting family members or friends or other people I'm close to. I've never physically hurt someone intentionally or done anything physically abusive, but I'm just stuck with these thoughts all the time. I won't describe them; it's pretty much the whole gamut of things you could imagine. These feelings will generally go away in like 20 minutes or so, though they'll come multiple times a day. But they're just so strong, I feel like I can barely see or something, and I get a headache that feels like I've been crying for a long time. I don't have a way to go to real non-CPS therapy. People keep telling me to if I don't explain my whole deal, but seriously, I don't have a way to go, so don't recommend it (I know you're going to anyway, and appeal to some sort of reason why I'm wrong, but just know I'm going to ignore you. When I have the ability to go in a few years, I will). I don't think there's really a way to get around this. I'm just venting I guess. I think I'm convinced that if I ever do snap I'll just go Kyle and punch a hole through the wall instead of hurting someone, and if I do that maybe the problem will be taken seriously enough that I can get admitted to a hospital or something like that. But sometimes these thoughts make me not want to interact with people for a while, just because they're making me feel like that too often for me to be able to handle, and I say something stupid, like that some fundamental characteristic of who they are is making me upset (disclaiming of course that it isn't because that characteristic is bad but because I am). And then I usually can't really talk to the person for like a month after this. Some of those friends I've gotten back. Most of them I haven't. I only really have one close friend right now, but lately I've been having these feelings, and I think I'm going to lose him. At least for a while, and possibly forever.

I'm just scared that I'm going to lose them. Since this concerns the one person I'm close to, I can't really talk to anyone about it. And also I don't want to be exposed as someone who has violent thoughts all the time obviously. So I probably won't reach out to DMs either. I'm sorry for bumming everyone out. I know that ""I need to get this off my chest"" doesn't justify bringing this up to a whole school, so I'll just log it as a bad decision. Whatever, not like I've got all that much to lose from making those anyway.",32039,

2/6/2021 9:03:10,"TW: white supremacy

I was on a run this morning at around 8:15am and a little bit north of the intersection of Jefferson & Valley I ran past this older white woman walking on the other side of the street when a white/silver sedan slowed down next to her and what I initially thought was an exchange of someone asking for directions. I looked back after a little bit and saw that she looked a bit bewildered and the car suddenly had on these flashing blue and orange lights and the woman was walking but the car was inching along next to her so I turned around and tried to draw his attention and so he pulled up next to me and was yelling things out his window (probably mid-50s, glasses), but I didn't take out my headphones to hear what he was saying because I was trying to deescalate the situation and didn't want to entertain it... I then abruptly turned around (at this point I'm on the right side of the sidewalk and he's clearly not adept enough to whip his car around like that) and ran back to the woman to make sure she was alright // to see wtf the guy was saying. The guy kept driving down towards Jefferson with his lights (situated in the back window of the sedan, didn't get the make) and the woman said he had been yelling things at her like ""you should rip out all of the BLM signs and through them in a pile and burn them,"" etc. but she also didn't get the license plate number. at this point I decided to run after him because I was 1) angry 2) wanted to get his plate number to report to... someone? he turned left on Jefferson towards N Harrison and I lost him pretty quickly.  

on an unfortunately related note, a few weeks ago my partner (asian) and I (white) were walking east down Nassau towards Whole Earth Center and there was a scary pirate-type preacher yelling shit on the sidewalk and declared on our first pass by him 'EVERYONE LOOK AT THE ODD COUPLE' and then on the second return trip back towards campus said directly to my partner that she 'wasn't in her country anymore' and then said to 'say hello to bugs bunny for me,' (which baffled both of us tbh). 

just wanted to make this post to make sure ppl are vigilant about the fascist & white supremacist threats in our neighborhoods, particularly as the 'community walk' program starts and such predators can leech off institutional legitimacy.",32070,

2/6/2021 16:49:37,"I felt the Cannon bicker article didn’t tell us much we didn’t already know about bicker. It only confirms that bicker is stupid, arbitrary, and depends on who you know way more than what sort of person you are. It’s also hypocritical because the author has, and will continue to, benefit from bicker. They do acknowledge their hypocrisy and say they feel ashamed, though. I would feel more positively if the author were to break anonymity. Remaining anonymous lets them continue to benefit from the Cannon alumni association. And why didn’t they publish this as a student, instead of years after benefiting from the system? Surely they knew back then how wrong and disgusting bicker is, so why wait until now to speak out? The author of this article feels ashamed about benefiting from a gross system, and they probably wrote this inflated exposé in order to assuage their own guilt. Because this article doesn’t actually accomplish anything— it adds no new information and doesn’t have any innovative calls for action. And after writing this, I stress they’re still able to benefit from bicker via alumni connections. A reasonable standard of moral consistency would demand that this author speak out against bicker in a way that would immediately stop them from ever having any benefit from it. If that would result in bad consequences or harassment for the author, then fine, don’t do it. But in that case, they should’ve just kept quiet anyways. That’s better than only pretending to care about those bicker hurts when actually you only care about making yourself not feel guilty about benefiting from a scummy system.",32093,

2/8/2021 16:06:30,"(Responding to 32187) I feel like people should be able to do what they want with regard to bicker. With the current system, if you want to bicker you can, and if you don’t want to but still want to be in a club you can sign-in, so there’s an option for everyone (and if you get hosed you can still get into a sign-in).

If every club was bicker it would actually be problematic, but that’s not the case. Imo, bicker is not inherently bad (but if it’s conducted discriminatorily, or it’s the only option, it would be).

Although I was double hosed, I really didn’t find the bicker process unpleasant at all (other than just getting tired of it taking so much time). Like, I have no idea why I wasn’t accepted, but I have no reason to suspect anything bad (and I got into a great sign-in, so everything worked out great).

If you don’t believe in bicker, don’t do it. I don’t really see why we should be getting worked up about people getting rejected from clubs they chose to apply to knowing that they could be rejected since that’s what the club does. (Obviously, some clubs have race/class/culture issues that are exacerbated by bicker, which is legitimately a problem, but this is a separate issue, and some clubs bicker but are nevertheless pretty chill.)",32205,

2/8/2021 19:26:24,"          To all these posts asking why some people defend bicker, I'll give you my take as someone who got hosed from one club but accepted into another. 
          To be honest, I like the outgoing personalities of people at my club. I like that a lot of people know existing members and that when you join it is so easy to enter an existing friend group. I like being able to have a say in who I am surrounded by. If someone makes me uncomfortable during bicker I can be sure that I won't have to be around them for years. If someone seems super sweet and fun I can advocate for them. I like going to the street on nights out and not being surrounded by a ton of underclassmen I don't know. 
          If you bickered and did not get in, I am super sorry and you have every right to complain as much as your heart desires. I love my club and think that bicker helps maintain the atmosphere of the club, but I definitely think aspects of the process are fucked up and need to be reformed. People need to be let down WAY easier and people should be made aware of haw scarce the spots are before bickering. There are so many random people who I thought were really cool and sweet but couldn't be accepted because of spots available. People who just got into a bicker club, please try to keep it off social media and be considerate of your friends!",32226,

Agreed. Also, regular clubs (student groups of all kinds), fraternities and sororities, university positions (TAs, RCAs, PAAs, etc.),  and Princeton itself are all pretty selective. What makes eating clubs so different that makes everyone say its selection process is bad?

I loved actually getting to know people in the club (pre-bicker events were just games and shit) before choosing to spend all my subsequent meals with them. And it's not like there's no other option or you are missing out on any tangible benefits except... eating at that specific building with those people (and priority for partying there).
With regards to the clubs where you need strong connections to get in... why would you want to hang out with people who are so strongly involved with their clique-circle that they prefer to not let others into their in-group?",32253,

we all did roughly the same thing and probably all did it fairly well. saying congratulations implies some kind of deservedness perhaps and while then implying some undeservedness of those who were hosed.

there is so much chance and subjectivity involved in this process that I don’t think an arbitrary acceptance warrants a “congrats” that so many others didn’t get to have (mysterious bicker reasons)

Not the mere fact that they can't take everyone. Bicker is also problematic because its value and effect on one's social life is overblown when in fact it doesn't determine anything and you can have an amazing social life without ever encountering a bicker club. It is structure and embedded in university life and expectations though, and that system is why it is so hurtful to those who didn't get in.

2/10/2021 17:35:32,"(Pre-face) 

This is my opinion, and I stand by it. While the reasoning is flawed, this was a writing exercise I thought I would share.

(Thesis)

I believe that violations of the Social Contract by intentionally gathering indoors in large quantities for the purpose of partying should be punishable by immediate expulsion from the University.

(Section I) Intent

Philosophically speaking, our society functions on the basis of intent rather than consequence. For instance, involuntary manslaughter is negligence. First degree murder is ""premeditated killings where the defendant formed the intent to kill through a process of reasoning or deliberation."" I'll let you guess which one gets the (much) harsher sentence. While this isn't a direct comparison (neither is it intended to be), it showcases something important about how we, as humans, judge behavior. We look at the cause and intent behind the action to decide whether it is permissible (or at least not as morally reprehensible). For COVID, consider two cases. First case: you walk into your friend's dorm unaware that the person already had four people over. Your friend tells you not to worry and that they are all very close friends. You hesitate but walk in anyways. Turns out somebody was infected, you all get COVID, spreading it to all others you interact with. Case 2: a group of people deliberately plan a large gathering fully aware that it is against the rules with the intent to act recklessly. Everyone involved is fully participating and consciously making the choice to violate the rules and hide the violation from the University and the rest of the community. The people in the party get COVID, so do outsiders who interact with them afterwards.

In the first case, the consequence of the gathering is unfortunate. In the second case, the consequence of the gathering is premeditated and expected. The act is malicious and reckless in relation to other people in the community.

(Section II) Sense of Sacrifice and Community

Since our early childhood, we were asked, “What do you want to do when you grow up?” Oftentimes this question became more explicit: “How will you want to contribute to society?” A growing child attempts to find his place in the world not only by finding something the child enjoys and can make sustainable, but also by evaluating whether it is useful and interactive with others. At some point in this process, we must reinforce and affirm that necessity for anyone participating. 

By not reacting to recklessness directed towards our community, we are devaluing our goals of unity. By not *removing* people who are reckless towards our community, we propagate it forward to our own detriment. 

If the goal is to teach everyone to place the whole above the individual in a setting of consistent threat (such as the pandemic), then leniency should not be permitted.

(Section III) Precedence and Deterrence

Suppose a ten-year old kid is told not to hit another child when playing. We can all agree that punching someone else in the face is unacceptable. The kid does so anyway. The kid is then told, ""Oh, you shouldn't have done that,"" and is led out of the room. The kid is let into the room some time later, and he does the same thing (or some other infracting act of violence). This happens because we have set a precedent that the kid will now associate simply ""lead away' with breaking a rule that should be quite strict. Leading the kid away from the room is not a good enough deterrent for him to not act on his recklessness.

Now consider our situation with COVID. A 20-year old student is told not to gather in large numbers indoors due to disease spread. We can all agree that doing so is unacceptable. However, if it is punished by “go into isolation” or “go away for now until further notice,” then the degree of that infraction is not honored and repeated offenses are likely.

(Conclusion)

One might say that expulsion would not be a good comparison, that kicking the infractors off-campus until the vaccine is available would suffice. However, it is not simply the act but once again, the attitude and intent. If a person murdered someone else with ill intent, would you pull him away and then let him go after a while once the dust settles? There is a reason why we don’t let such offenders come back into society. So is there a reason why such leniency should be allowed when other people’s lives are at stake with COVID? If one cannot follow rules that ensure community safety now, lenient treatment of such infractions sets a precedent to permit the same recklessness in the future, whether in the family, at work, or other settings. A slap on the wrist is not an effective deterrent. Everyone wants to be slapped on the wrist. Nobody wants the wrist cut off, and that’s what the deterrent should be in the University’s case: expulsion.",32388,

Just to say that like one of the commenters said, I also got diagnosed with OCD through CPS in a surprisingly quick way. I thought was going through might be OCD (I did a ton of research ab it before I got diagnosed which is a compulsion in it of itself whoops), and going to CPS and letting them know was probably one of the best decisions of my life. So much relief in getting a diagnosis and, when I could, starting exposure response prevention, which is so shitty at first but then way better. And also when I went to CPS I didn’t share the full extent of my intrusive thoughts because I didn’t feel comfortable doing so (for the fear that they somehow reflect who I am which they do NOT) and even by explaining some of the ones that I was okay with sharing and then the pattern of compulsions I do once these thoughts arise CPS was able to diagnose me and refer me to a specialist. I don’t want to assume anything about your situation OP but if it sounds similar to mine pls know that dealing with these thoughts takes practice which is excruciating but there are effective ways to get better at it!

Meanwhile, my jobs were dishes, laundry,  vacuuming, cleaning, grocery shopping, helping with dinner, etc. One time, dad literally came to my room, stopped me from studying, and told me to do the dishes. When I got to the kitchen, I saw that all three of them were just watching a movie. So there’s an example of the dynamic in our family for ya. Basically, whenever mom isn’t home, I become the new mom but I have no authority whatsoever. So a worse version basically.

I mean I’m all for dividing up the chores and even for letting men do the more physically demanding ones, whatever. But I think mowing the yard once a week and taking out the trash maybe once a day is SO not equal to hours of cleaning every. single. day. I’ve already discussed this with my boyfriend and I can’t wait to move in with him. Saw this on tiktok and def recommend trying it:
Each person lists their absolute least fav chores and then we figure out together which ones are about equal, and we divide them up. He hates folding laundry, so I’ll do that if he takes care of taking out the trash/cleaning the trash can regularly.

This is my opinion, and I stand by it. Am I willing to recognize the reasoning is flawed? Yes. Am I doing this not so much because of the opinion itself but to use TC# as a practice ground for my argumentative writing? Yes. Do I stand by my opinion? Still yes.

(Thesis)

I believe that any Princeton student, current or former, who pours milk before their cereal must be expelled from the school (or their degree be revoked). In a better society, such offenders would be sent to jail, however that is beyond the scope of this project.

(Section I) Society

Our society is highly societal in its nature. In fact, at times, our society can feel almost like a society within a society, or a society that is not a society at all. Philosophically speaking, society is an inherently self-contradictory concept as the notion of a society immediately implies that no such society can exist.

(Section II) On Crime and Punishment

Pouring milk before cereal may seem like a harmless deed. But is it not wrong? Is our society (visit Section I for further reading) at a place where ""harmless"" sins are not worth punishing? Should we defend cereal killers -- who torture and murder cereal in their masochistic hellfire of sogginess -- simply because we deem them less harmful than serial killers?

(Conclusion)

I am aware that reading this may be a daunting task. I thank those who read until the end. My views may be radical, and my logic... seemingly non-existent. But saying outrageous things will almost always draw an audience.",32459,

obviously i know it was due to making catholicism more palatable for potential concerts to increase conversion rates, kinda like how christmas was allowed to be reappropriate to make christianity more appealing for non christians, but even then, regardless of how much you secularize it, it just seems inherently rooted in idolatry or associating partners with God. especially since in accordance with christian doctrine, most of those ancestors were likely non christians and in either heaven or hell anyway now",32478,

2/11/2021 22:40:31,"The Cannon alum who wrote about bicker and the inside of Cannon discussions as if it were news, when it was not to the FLI, POC, those with disabilities, etc, made those with privilege suddenly aware of how ""unequal"" the bicker process actually is. I would like to say in the defense of the Cannon officers, the president I consider a friend, that they specifically expressed hesitation of doing Zoom bicker and preferred that it was not done. I’d also like to point out that the University ALLOWED this. In fact, with the University giving the eating clubs money for the spring, if they did not want this then they could have easily expressed concerns that would have heavily swayed the eating clubs’ disposition. The University expressed support of this detrimental system for the sake of “normalcy”. Though, I do believe that specific offices like SHARE, CPS, etc. would have strongly urged the postponing of bicker. Why? Because isolation in a pandemic is already damaging to mental health, let’s add social rejection to that as well! Too bad that the offices of undergraduate life preferred “normalcy”. 

As for the article and its “informative” infographics, I have only a few comments on what was not so surprising or informative. The big reveal in that article is that it is mostly athletes conspiring with other teams to get teammates into the club and that it was a who you know basis rather than anything substantial in terms of personality. I can say that 87% of people get into their first club (circa 2020 Street Week) and 93% get into their 2nd choice. So approximately 130 do not get their first choice and 70 do not get their second choice. While this may seem few, which would be great if it were truly reflective, it indicates that no one is trying for clubs they do not think they could obtain. So, while Cannon discussions overwhelmingly favor those who know people in the clubs without regards to personality, this is not new amongst any of the selective clubs. Open clubs also operate on this who you know basis, but that is simply to get people through the door without having to turn anyone away. Why is Cannon’s bicker article even at all newsworthy at this point? As if we cannot gather how these processes worked, especially after the 2017 Ivy bicker cards (now that was a fun read).",32486,

-each of them has been drinking, is drinking, or will drink an average of 3 cans of water every -day of the semester.
-the semester is 112 days long, from 1/24/20 (last day you could arrive and be done

2/12/2021 16:27:15,"Went to pick up a package at mailroom 110 and presented my prox (as I was instructed in the email), which the mail guy refused. He demanded my mailbox number, which I told him I didn't know off the top of my head, and he seemed incredulous and told me to look it up. After a few minutes of futile attempts to find it on my phone (I forgot tigerhub doesn't work on mobile, and I didn't know where to find the directory), he asked very patronizingly if I was a freshman, to which I responded I was not, and I've only needed my mailbox number like twice in my entire time here (just when I first gave it to my parents and put it into my shipping information on Amazon), and I've never been asked for it when picking up a package (including when I went two days ago), explanations which he found unsatisfactory. Eventually he got tired of this and scanned my prox and got my package for me in like 20 seconds, and very aggressively pointed to the sticker on the side with my name and mailbox number as if that was helpful.

Has anyone experienced this before? Don't understand if he was just being a dick for the sake of being a dick or if he's dumb or if there's some special mailbox number requirement that I've somehow never been exposed to in my years at Princeton, but it was very strange.

2/15/2021 11:33:32,"questions about relationships, from an aroace who is occasionally reminded that dating is a real thing that people actually do here: 

(1) why are there like 45679348 different princeton-specific dating websites? do new ones get created because the previous ones were dysfunctional? or is it a business thing where people make them because there’s a huge market for them? are the organizers making money off of these? 

(2) statistically how do people get into relationships at all? like as a ballpark estimate, assuming gender balanced social circles of 150 people and that orientations are split 75% straight - 12% bi/pan - 12% gay - 1% ace**,  if your current crush is of the opposite gender there is about a 1% chance they like you back and if they’re the same gender then it’s 0.25% (idk exactly how nonbinary people factor into this but it would probably be even harder for them). If you change your crush after the previous person rejects you, you would still on average get rejected 100 - 400 times before finding someone who likes you back. This is probably where the dating websites come in, to match you with people where you have a higher than average chance of liking each other, but it shouldn’t be *that* much higher than the initial probability, and some people manage to find relationships without the dating websites too? something doesn’t add up. 

(3) why is it normal to stop talking to someone who friendzoned you? isn’t being friends a good thing? this happened to my sister - her close friend of 8 years confessed his undying love for her and then when she didn’t reciprocate he just never interacted with her again. first of all this is a jerk move. second of all in these situations people sympathize with the person who was rejected and vilify the other person. sometimes, especially with guy friends, I get paranoid that they like me romantically and that our entire friendship hinges on the fact that they haven’t told me that yet. I genuinely enjoy spending time with these people, and if you have a crush on someone then you would enjoy spending time with them too, so why throw that away? 

(4) why do people call their significant others “baby” when in any non-romantic context, calling someone a baby would be an insult? I have been wondering this for years. 

.**sources vary wildly on this split. I picked these specific numbers because they seem reasonable and make the calculations easy.  for the social circles, you could make a case to expand the size which would make the chances even lower, but I don’t think you would reduce the size",32651,

Hey I definitely understand why your s.o's response scared you and I highly encourage all the comments suggesting CPS, their religious group, all that.

I just want to state that I can definitely understand that kind of statement.
When I'm going through difficult periods in my life or dealing with a lot of stress I often think something similar. It's not anything depressive or dealing with suicidal thoughts but more of me knowing that the pain, etc. I'm experienced isn't gonna be a permanent fixture of my experience. I'm an atheist, so my saying that isn't, ya know, like a ""I can't wait to die so I can be with god sooner"" statement, but I can also get that there can be comfort in thinking about that for those who do, memento mori and all that.

Again though, definitely follow all the responses that have already shown up, and try to discern whether their response is an indicator of distress (talk to CPS, and be up front) or something along what I said. I'm not too well versed in mental health and crises, but I thought that mine might be a bit of a different take.",32670,

Since I’m gonna graduate in a few months (hopefully lol), I have been doing a LOT of reflecting on my time at Princeton. I know COVID hasn’t made things easier, but there are soooo many things I would do differently if I had another chance here. I would explore my interests freshman year so I could make a choice about my major sooner and not waste two semesters on classes I don’t even end up needing just because I think I know what I should do. I would go to more events and talk to more people and make more friends. I would accept more invitations to hang out even if I’m tired or feeling like having a lazy night. I would join more clubs because I can always drop out later if it does end up being too much of a time commitment. I would try really hard to make this time special because it’s supposed to be special. I know COVID hinders a lot of these activities, but just try. Try your hardest to make these four years as memorable and special as you can. They passed way faster than high school did, and I’m not being cheesy when I say I really can remember what it first felt like to set foot on campus. It was big, beautiful, chilly, and magical. The magic kinda went away when I spent all my time in my dorm or in wucox or frist. I wish I had kept the magic and explored every nook and cranny. I wish, I wish, I wish. Don’t catch yourself having all of these wishes when it comes time for you to leave. Okay, done imparting wisdom. Gonna go cry and work on my thesis.

2/19/2021 10:04:39,"April 24, 10:00 AM - 4 days before The Week of Reckoning
With COVID cases on the rise, the University decides to close extra library spaces just four days before Reading Period. Students on campus have two choices: study in the room they've spent the last three months in or fight for reservations for the few remaining study spaces.

April 27, 10:00 AM - 1 day before The Week of Reckoning
The fight for reservations is in full swing. Students have taken different strategies to ensure they'd have a space to study. Some in the COS department set up automated programs to scan the system for any free spots. Many off-campus students decide to reserve spots that they sell at a high price to on-campus students late to the game.

April 29, 9:39 PM - Night 2 of The Reckoning
The reservations proved useless. This is war, and there are no rules in war. Turf gangs form: the Lewis Lackeys have a strong hold on Lewis Library, but the frosh guerilla fighters pose a serious threat. The center of the warfare is in Firestone, where each floor is held by a rival group. 

The war is fought long and hard. Some opt for physical weapons, using month old bread rolls as grenades and physics textbooks as shields. Others find rhetoric to be their strongest weapon. On the night of the 29th, an unknowing sophomore is lost to the crossfire after hearing ""of course human rights violations are always wrong, but let me play Devil's Advocate here."" The gangs decide to form a temporary truce, but it doesn't last.

The Aftermath
As finals week begins, the University mourns. No one was unaffected by the Reckoning, and most saw a side of themselves they hope to forget about. The vast majority of USG is forced to resign, from counts of corruption to charges of sedition.

""It's funny you know... they always called it The Reckoning. Nobody really knows why. But the real reckoning happened after it was all over. We all had to learn to face what we had done. How would we tell our children one day? How would we ever prove ourselves to be better than this?"" - unknown student, several weeks after The Reckoning",32873,

2/20/2021 0:52:46,"The year is 2043. Amazon has become a monopoly like none other in human history. Jeff Bezos is the world's first trillionaire with an estimated net worth of 2.6 trillion dollars. He decides to donate .5% of his wealth (13 billion dollars) to Princeton University.

The following are snippets of life at Princeton University in the year 2043.

Todd and Melissa
""Want to meet up at Bezos Library to go over the PSET?"" Todd asked. He had recently transferred out of the Bezos School of Public and Int'l Affairs to enter BSE (Bezos School of Engineering). He was going to have to take MAT201 a bit more seriously now. ""Ah I can't unfortunately. I've got to go to Bezos Campus Center to pick up a package then I've got a two-hour lecture in Bezos Hall. Maybe tomorrow?""

A Clash like None Other
""With 1097 points, Jeffrey College wins this year's Clash of the Colleges! Congratulations to the very close runner-up, Third Bezos College. In third place was Jeff College, in fourth was Preston College, in fifth was First Bezos College, in sixth was Second Bezos College. Thank you to all of our competitors!""

The ""Prince"" - Apply to join The Daily Princetonian's new investigative journalism team! We will be tackling important questions such as ""is Amazon the world's best company"" and ""is Jeff Bezos the second coming of Jesus?"" (Sponsored by the Washington Post)

2043 may seem like a grim year. But at least we're not UPenn. Hearing ""Bezos"" everywhere can get on your nerves, but it sounds better than the Musk School of Business.",32919,

Above all I deeply admire her for how real she is and how she shares her own experiences to better the lives of other people. She knows and can relate to other people's issues and is one of the only people I know with a heart big enough to fully address their issues and resolve them. Reading everything she has said on here for so many months now, even though I don't know her too well personally, I don't think I've seen anyone represent fellow women empowerment as consistently and empathetically as she does. She stands up for her fellow women so much and provides endless love for them, and I wish everyone was just like her! She has the makings of a true leader and the world is a better place because of her. I can't wait to see what she does next and hope that she touches our lives tomorrow as she does today!",32921,

2/20/2021 20:38:17,"You have no idea what time it is. In your quest to find slightly less shitty food, you ventured to a remote corner of campus : the Rocky/Mathey area. This was a grave mistake, as now you are trapped there. Every time you leave the courtyard you find yourself back in the same courtyard. In one last valiant attempt to make sense of this before you abandon the concept of Euclidean geometry forever, you try sketching a map in the snow, but you look away for a few seconds and then it’s gone. You go through an arch that you maybe haven't tried yet, and end up in the opposite corner. 

There are two people on the benches silently judging you. One only speaks in tautologies and the other only speaks in paradoxes. They also have a pet tiger who only says the word “unprecedented”  over and over. 

The first one looks up from eating Pringles long enough to say, “If you ask us for directions, you will have asked us for directions.” 

You’ve heard of these riddles before. You need to think of a clever question to get information. You’ve been trying to come up with the right question for - who knows how long it’s been but you’ve probably missed a couple pset deadlines by now.  Words are coming out of your mouth, but you don’t know what they are and you can’t seem to make yourself stop. Even the tiger is better at communicating than you. It walks up to a door which you swear wasn’t there a minute ago, and says, “Unprecedented.”

A sweet ray of hope echoes through your thoroughly exhausted soul as you drag yourself towards the door. With a trembling arm, you reach out to scan your prox card - 

“SYMPTOM CHECK!”

A slap on your back forces all the air out of your lungs. As you fall to the ground, you catch a glimpse of Eisgruber holding a 6 foot long Pringles tube like a baseball bat, while Dean Dolan stands behind him scribbling something on a clipboard. You try to explain, but it’s hard to talk because you’re choking on your spit, and they don’t believe you when you say you’re just choking on your spit even though it's their fault you're choking on your spit, and as the helicopter airlifts you to an isolation dorm your only thought is that you should have just spent the extra money at Wawa.

And how do you deescalate without police intervention them when they threaten violence or running away?

Ugh I guess one day we really do become our parents' keepers, I just wish there was a handbook on how to deal with this stuff, or someone to talk to.

2/21/2021 14:54:58,"My roommates are constantly being physically affectionate with each other (hugging, cuddling, etc, all platonically) and I am happy for them that they are able to enjoy each other. But I am never given any physical affection, even though my roommates and I are all pretty close friends with each other (and it has been explicitly acknowledged by us that we're all close, this isn't me feeling closer than I actually am with them, I think). Obviously I am not ever *entitled* to receive physical affection from another person, and I would never take any action to manipulate myself into getting affection. In fact precisely this is why I am afraid to mention this issue or ask for it because I feel that even asking creates pressure or is awkward or both. But even though I know this I can't help feeling sad and left out. I wouldn't really characterize what I feel as envy or jealousy though, maybe? I don't feel resentful towards my roommates, it's me feeling sad and mopey that my own need for physical affection is not met at all while the people I'm constantly around are meeting that need for each other. Also, this is a separate yet related issue, I've felt really disconnected socially from my roommates and their friend group this semester, and I often get the vibe that they prefer interacting with each other to interacting with me. I sometimes (not ""often"") don't feel ""interacted-with"" or ""talked-to"" in conversation, and I've experienced hurtful jokes about some of my (objectively inoffensive) personal beliefs. Both the social and physical weirdness I feel means I've been just feeling generally isolated from them. I've brought up some of the social stuff, but there wasn't a meaningful attempt to change their actions or make me feel more included or really support me/understand what I feel, even though I suggested some easy, pressure-less solutions. Finally I don't want this post to be a pity party but I feel that a lot of what I wrote here is my fault, because I am extremely shy and introverted and cannot ""do"" social stuff to save my life. I don't exactly know why I wrote this other than to vent. Feel free to give advice, maybe it'd be helpful. But really I just want a (real but virtual is okay too) hug from someone who I can be absolutely confident that they genuinely love and support me. Fuck COVID.",33009,

We hardly ever talked while in the room and also whenever he would see me outside our dorm or in the dining hall with his other friends, he would never acknowledge me. Once, we were eating with some people in our zee group and I felt very uncomfortable because he would not even look me in the eye or ever talk to me or acknowledge my presence in the setting. It was as though he was embarrassed to sit with me at the table (there was also some power dynamic involved as he is white and I am a person of color). I tried to initiate some conversations in our room but he would never reciprocate. I always wanted to--and still want to--be friends with him or at least get to know him and for him to know me. We only had a meal together once on the second or third day of the first week of school after returning from our CA/OA trips. When we had that brunch together, he learned a few things about me which surprised him. Roommate, I hope wherever you are this semester you're well and healthy, and if you're reading this I want to tell you that if I ever did anything inadvertently wrong or bad to you, I apologize for it most sincerely, because I never intended to hurt or wrong you in any way. I hope next fall when we're back on campus as juniors, we can be good friends and get to know each other. You haven't responded to the texts I sent you, but I think of you every now and then and despite your behavior toward me when we lived together I am cautiously optimistic that you are a person with a good heart and a good conscience--and deep down I hope you secretly think the same about me.

A Progressive Push Forward
""Here at the College of New Jersey, we pride ourselves on diversity. We are proud to announce this year we had an incredible jump to a student body made up of 40% non-Virginians. We are well aware of the strides we need to continue to take to ensure that problems such as the smallpox epidemic do not continue to disproportionately affect our white male students whose fathers did not sign the Constitution. This country puts enough obstacles in the way of wealthy white men who own less than 3000 acres of land; it is our job to level the playing field.""

John and George
""You really have to stop checking the mail, man. She's not sending you a love letter back. It's been two years. If she wanted to write back, you'd have gotten a pigeon after easily five months, this is getting ridiculous."" George tried to talk some sense into his friend, but he knew it was no use. John responded, ""I don't know bro she may be the one. She's also into farming and we both like Mozart. It's a match made in Heaven."" George knew better than to push it. ""I'm getting back to Algebra II. I'm literally taking the most advanced math none to man. I have better things to do than hear your sorry ass complain.""

I know all the winners are wonderful people who absolutely deserve their recognition but it still feels like shit to think about all the things I could have done differently (sought out resources, connected with professors, participated more in class, joined more groups, met more friends, etc etc.) if I hadn't started Princeton in such a deep depression that took two full years to climb out of. I'm resentful of the fact that there's a chance it could have been me if that hadn't been the case, and that prizes don't reflect such hardship--in fact, they're awarded with a ""rich get richer"" mentality re: GPA, stability, connections, sociability, and so on. But I also recognize the fact that I've been conditioned to think of such prizes as defining my happiness, which is a mentality I need to grow away from. A lot of us were ""the best"" in HS and we're devastated by the realization that we're not ""objectively"" ""the best"" anymore. We got a little bit addicted to ""honors""--we just constantly want more. I know that I deeply crave that kind of recognition--I work so hard!!--but I recognize that I'll never be satisfied if I do get it.

I'm trying to make mental space for grieving my ""lost years"" and missed/unachieved opportunities while also appreciating the things I've learned and how I grew (I grew so much!!!!) while also looking toward the future with a sense of optimism, even if I'm scared of how wide open it seems. All these things can exist in the mind at once. OP I believe in you and I know firsthand how awful it is to always be told no but keep plugging at it and seeking out resources.... and I know how impossible it sounds, but try and focus on what actually makes you happy and makes your life meaningful for you. That doesn't take away the disappointment (I'm still dealing with it too) or the anxiety of what might or might not be announced at departmental graduation but it can build you up in other ways. Princeton isn't the end of the road either, at least that's what I'm telling myself--there's so much out there in life for you to achieve on your own terms, things that make you happy as opposed to a title or thing that other people bestow upon you or not without knowing your whole story. The education we received is itself a gift--being here itself is an incredible achievement. No cap, I find myself in awe of that, too, coming to the end of my experience here--it was incredible to have been able to experience what it meant to go to school here, even if I wasn't ultimately ""the best"" by these standards. I am angry and disappointed and frustrated and grateful and scared and optimistic all at once and trying to recognize that that's normal and OK.",33133,

I fidget, constantly bouncing my leg or tapping my fingers, etc. I have a really hard time focusing when it comes to long things. I’ve come up with tricks to force myself to stay attentive, I have a list of the number of minutes left in each class at the top of my notes page and I go one by one through each number back and forth and I delete (or erase) the first number when a minute has finally passed, then I repeat over and over until class is over. After telling him this and then looking into more of my habits, like breaking all of my tasks into the absolute smallest of possible pieces, fear of many foods, anxiety caused by changes of plans, crowds, loud noises, uncontrollable thoughts about accidentally hurting myself (like scratching the inside of my nose, bending my nails backwards, etc), fear of certain ‘gross’ things, his saliva being one, my to do list every single day of each task I will do (including a different bullet for brushing teeth, brushing hair,, taking birth control, taking a vitamin, etc), and a need to count things, especially when they are in an orderly shape, constant cleaning, and schedules for my cleaning, ........ we both think I might have OCD?

2/24/2021 18:57:23,"The humble potato. It looks like a dusty brown germ, accidentally burped out by the cosmos, was frozen in the middle of a painful writhe. Yet we love it, producing over 661 billion pounds of the thing worldwide every year. 

From the American waiting in line for a baked one at Wendy's to the Kenyan artfully mashing one with peas and corn to create the East African staple dish Irio, potatoes are everywhere, an important component of national diets worldwide. It was first grown 8,000 years ago in the Andes Mountains, where the Inca mastered its cultivation, and spread via the Columbian Exchange to Europe in the 1500s before eventually becoming so ubiquitous that you can buy a plastic one as a toy, complete with limbs and a wife. Today, China and India grow more potatoes than anyone else. The thing is really healthy, with lots of potassium and vitamin C but virtually no fat. Plus, it's goofy looking. No wonder it's one of the most important crops on the planet. Its widespread consumption is one of the reasons we're taller than our ancestors in the 1400s.

(I apologize for fangirling. It's just that epic a vegetable.)

However, for all the adoration showered on the little spud today, its initial international reception was cold. Europeans were really skeptical of the ugly tuber born on the other side of the world. Its ghastly and lumpy appearance earned it a very unfair reputation for causing flatulence, leprosy, lust, and just about every other deadly sin. Though it slowly gained trust among some peasants and the growing urban poor for its nutritional value and hardiness during wartime, elites continued to loathe it. France even banned the potato entirely in 1748. Imagine! As if that wasn't wild enough, in England the potato became symbolically intertwined with Catholicism and was dismissed with the catchy rallying cry, ''No Potatoes, no Popery!''. I'd put that bumper sticker on my car.

Suffice to say, it was hard to have self-confidence as a potato in the 16th -18th centuries.

Enter our protagonist and dissenter: scientist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier. During the Seven Years War he spent three years as a Prussian prisoner of war. His cruel captors fed him nothing but horse food - i.e., potatoes. Instead of growing a second head or succumbing to leprosy, however, he returned to France after the war in excellent health. Inspired by the potato, Parmentier spent the rest of his life lobbying for the potato. As popular historian Greg Jenner puts it, ''Parmentier began a long campaign to convince scientists, farmers, the French government, and the superstitious population that potatoes were a useful alternative to bread and not some fart-inducing aphrodisiac that made your legs fall off.'' 

He did so, through outrageous PR stunts. He got Marie Antoinette to wear potato flowers in her hair. He served the dish to Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, the latter of whom supposedly popularized french fries in the US when he got back. Parmentier even allowed starving peasants to steal potatoes from his own fields so their fame would grow. The result was a revolution in diets and life expectancies across the continent as the plucky and yummy potato was planted everywhere. Europe's food supply doubled, bringing an end to the famines that had plagued European countrysides every ten years or so. Europe could reliably feed itself, which allowed it to focus on other things, like the Industrial Revolution. The potato changed world history, and it would not have happened without Parmentier's pushing back on the status quo. 

Yet one cannot think of the potato without thinking of the Irish. The potato became the manna of the have-nots in Europe, composing up to a third of commoners' entire diets in many countries. In Ireland, 40% of people ate no solid food but the potato. This over-reliance on a single crop (indeed, a single strand of potato), a situation perpetuated by British misrule, left millions without food when a blight wiped out potatoes in the 1840s. One million Irish died, and two million emigrated.

A Million Years in a day, Greg Jenner - pages 75 - 80

'24 here. Last week, some of the other frosh started discussing paranormal experiences and sleep paralysis in our class chat. I've actually had a recent experience with sleep paralysis during my first couple weeks here at Princeton, but I wasn't comfortable publicly sharing so I've decided to come clean on TC instead.

About halfway through my initial quarantine period, my sleep schedule got really off track and I started having issues sleeping for anything other than short periods of time. 

One night, after trying to fix my sleep schedule by going to bed at 9pm, I woke up around 1am and couldn't move. I could move my eyes and could see the underside of my upper bunk bed, but the rest of my body felt like it was glued to my sheets and my body felt like it was entirely tensed up. Eventually I was able to fall back asleep but it was a harrowing experience that I still remember.

The next morning, I was able to get up and go about my day without any problems, but I still felt shaken and not rested, so I checked my bed. It turns out that I had shat the bed during the night and got stuck to the bed.

I hope that my experience can serve as an example for any other frosh who have undergone similar experiences.",33238,

When I reached the other side they shouted at me from across the street. At first I thought maybe it was someone I knew and just couldn’t see + I couldn’t hear them, so I replied “huh?” back to them. They repeated themselves a couple times bc I still couldn’t really hear but by the last time, they visibly shook their head and kept walking. My brain kinda processed what happened after the fact and it sounded like they said something like “are you really that mean??”, and when they shouted they didn’t seem exactly friendly either. So basically by the way I was walking and the fact that I happened to cross right when they were approaching me I guess it seemed like I was actively avoiding them??

- DISCLAIMER: this will cause no harm to any grandparents trust me
- estimate how much longer the grandparent has to live based off of their current age, breed, etc
- multiply that number by 1.25
- forget about the person for as long as you've calculated (life expectancy x 1.25) but keep their contact info
- one day randomly reach out to them with a seemingly kind note saying something like the following ""Hey [blank], I just wanted to let you know how much our short but sweet friendship/etc meant to me...

No matter how kind, or how pure hearted, they may be I cannot find a soul amongst the skies who touches my heart the same. But yet, somehow I turn a page and read Michelle Dai's responses, be it to the insufferable raging crowds or those in need of dire help, filled with the same pure-heartedness we all dream to see in our own lives, as we look up to the skies for hope day after day. As I read each word she beautifully pens, I cannot help but hear the melodies of the early morning hours once again, except this time, in true harmony, with the angelic voice present once again. Michelle is our guardian angel, showering us with unprecedented love we never deserved, and there isn't a shred of doubt in our minds about it. As each passing day comes, I always crave her responses, to see what the pinnacle of kindness amounts to time and time again. How lucky her friends must be to have her in their lives, and I can only hope that one day I can have her in mine. She makes our world complete, filling us with love and affection always without a shred of hesitation. As we march forward, into the blossoming spring, I can only hope that along with the sun shining at its brightest once more, that our angel of Princeton can share her love for us once again, and even more.

That is not to say that the choice to stay off campus or not participate in the testing program wasn’t their own, but Princeton should have let people know that there was even a possibility that it would affect their ability to graduate with their peers. I’m sure a lot of people might have made a different decision. Off campus seniors missing out on local events is one thing, having them miss out on graduation is another. 

I know things are still undecided and they’re still looking at a solution, but the information sent out indicates that if they don’t find one, that they find only letting a percentage of seniors do virtual graduation while the others get to be in person and have that experience and memory acceptable if it came to it, and it’s not. 

Even still, had they not moved it up, they could have offered off campus students housing for a 2 week period (isolation) before graduation. It would have been after exams for the most part and allowed students to be tested and quarantined so that they could participate. ",33554,

But more than that, that question requires and expects me to have the emotional space to guide that person rather than them thinking of what they can do themselves or simply acting.

3/2/2021 10:55:43,"A.B. Distribution requirement tier list:

S: Language classes

Not a single other distribution's professors care about their students like a language department's professors. Enough said. 

A:EM

There's a lot of different cool things you can do with EM. Even the STEMiest of STEMbros can find a humanities class within this distribution and PDF it and still feel like they're being enlightened by an expert in their field.

B: QR, LA

QR: Yeah, math classes are hard. But it's a common rite of passage that stands consistently year after year. Not to mention a lot of cool ORF and other STEM classes that pull math up. No matter what class year you were in you can always share a story from a QR, and anyone who's taken it can relate. Definitely can be a struggle for humanities folks (well, more of a struggle than it already is) , I'll give you, but luckily there are a few easier QR classes.

LA: English/Literature classes are often what you expect, which is good, but higher level art classes are epic and even noobs can enjoy them. Oh, and let's not forget the fact that theatre classes exist in all their PDFO glory. Could easily be higher ranked if it weren't for the fact that many classes are inconsistently offered. Definitely more B+ tier than B

C: EC, HA

EC? Kinda feels like the one nobody remembers or cares about. LIN201 and what else again? It feels oddly overly specific to be a distro req, and as such there's not a lot of variety here. I don't want to take introductory logic, and I don't think I should have to. But hey, the silver lining is that when you take these classes you always end up having a friend who happens to be in it with you.

HA: History isn't bad. It's just a similar style of learning, and the 200 level history departmentals are bleh. A lot of things that could theoretically be HA and are good end up being SA. Admittedly I didn't pay much attention in mine, but learning history is still cool. As an overall distribution requirement though, it fails to stand out.

D: SA

Don't get me wrong: there are many many good classes here on very deep and interesting topics. Race, colonialism, the economy, sociology, grand strategy- I just cannot forgive the SA distribution for letting people get away with ECO100 and ECO101. No disrespect to them, but that is NOT in the same category as what good SAs are, including better higher level econ classes. Easily could just jump multiple spots if you made those classes QR where they should be, especially 100. (I, OP, am also an econ major, so I'm not biased)

F: Writing Seminar

Seriously, this class blows. Are there any other classes at Princeton whose grade is more correlated with the quality of your high school education/wealth/privilege and native English speaker status than this one? Yeah, you do learn important topics about writing, I'll give you that. It is a requirement for a reason! Oh, and I can't let the fact that, until this year's calendar change, fall writing sem effectively gave you more time to do the work than the spring. It's also largely geared towards AB students which means BSE kids feel like what they're learning won't ultimately be useful. Could we not just have even like a social science-esque writing sem so at least some kids can learn slightly more technical writing? The final nail in the coffin is that many writing seminar descriptions are largely inaccurate or even intentionally misleading. Barf. And you can't even leave public comments on tigerhub/Princeton courses when it's over. You get an F, writing sem, for obvious reasons.",33564,

There's a specific kind of person, normally female, often involved in dance/theater, always having 'quirky crackhead Sarah' vibes. They are the source of all ""it's tchewsday innit luv"" jokes. They often roam in packs and being introduced into one of these packs is the most surreal thing. I say something like ""hi"". They start giving each other the side eye thinking, could it be true? I say a few more lines and it clicks in their heads that I own a british accent. The leader of the pack, the crackheadiest of them all, finally plucks up the courage, ""it's tchewsday innit luv"", she bellows. The whole clique bursts into laughter. ""Omg Sarah you didn't you're so quirky"". But Sarah has given the pack confidence and an orchestra of ""it's tchewsday innit luv"" soon follows. In these moments I wonder how I got here, and what my family would think about the reality of my existence. What stands out most however, is that there is usually one who has a shockingly good accent (it's never Sarah). I leave half impressed, half wondering how many unsuspecting Brits she's practiced on.

So I left my room last night to go work on a pset with someone, and stopped to drop off my covid test on the way. Very normal evening, I worked on the pset, went to bed, and didn’t notice anything amiss until this afternoon, when I found a (last nights?) covid test in my coat pocket. Thinking back over the evening, I’m CERTAIN I submitted something in the drop box, because I was with my roommate and have a distinct recollection of her opening it for me. I also checked and I haven’t missed any other tests, so this had to be last night’s. So I mentally retraced my steps and I remember leaving my room holding my phone, my test, a sparkling water, and a piece of cake (you know, the chocolate bread/muffin/cake slice thing that comes in those little baggies from the dining hall). I can't remember eating the cake like I planned once I got to my friend's room. I was also on snapchat and talking to my roommate throughout this whole process so my mind was elsewhere. Therefore, I have come to the logical conclusion that the cake was the plastic bag-like item that I put in the testing box. What is an appropriate reaction in this situation? To whom should I apologize for putting cake in the covid samples? Has anyone else had a similar problem??",33622,

Do you find it better or worse if, rather than ask , friends just say ""i hope you feel better""? Or is ""Let me know if I can do anything"" better? As someone who has a lot of friends going through various things, I never know what I'm supposed to do to help or how to ""take action"" - especially when they're far away and I couldn't, like, drop by with food or something. Like I don't want to annoy them further by saying something meaningless and inane or make them stressed by trying to plan something/do something but I want them to know I'm there for them, and reading various confessions (obviously not all from the same person)/overhearing other conversations about bad ways to help makes me even more anxious about what would be helpful vs useless",33623,

3/3/2021 10:16:03,"Types of Tiger Confessions Posts Tier List:

S: Thoughtful Thank Yous, High-Quality Shitposts

Thoughtful Thank Yous to campus staff, student groups, etc. create a great vibe and help us keep things in perspective. 

High-Quality shitposts are the real staple of TC that you won't get anywhere else. They can point out absurdities at Princeton or just be a long-form Eisgruber meme, but they are solid either way.

A: Reflections, Memes/Jokes

Occasionally there are really great Reflections on this page that can serve as great advice for frosh and seniors alike. They may take some time to read and thus be easy to miss, but it's worth taking the time to check them out every once in a while.

Quick hitting Memes/Jokes may have the best ratio of enjoyment:time spent reading of any type of post.

B: Rants/Vents/Sad Posts, Campus Discussion/Improvement, Shoutouts

Nothing is quite as cathartic as a TC Vent. Just make sure it's not like... lightly transphobic or something... The fact that these sometimes slip into flaming hot take territory bring this down a tier.

Campus Discussion/Improvement posts are great in theory but they usually end up being a shitshow about the faults of Bicker. S/o to the ones that really put some thought into it and come up with originality.

While I usually pay little attention to Shoutouts on this page, I think they create a good vibe and must feel nice for those receiving them. Gives TC more of a community spirit.

C: ""Do-good"" Reminders, ""Anyone else interested in..."", Post Follow-Ups, Meta Posts

“Do-good” Reminders are another one that is hard to rank because of the range here. Some are great, reminding us to be more aware of issues others may be struggling with. However, these are often prone to being hyper-critical and condescending.

The ""anyone else interested in..."" are great in theory but not sure how often these actually result in new friends or group chats. Maybe they do though, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here.

Post Follow-Ups are quite possibly the most underrated type of TC post. Whether it's giving more backstory for a confusing confession or defending a hot take that got ratio'd, these posts create a sense of narrative that is hard to find on an anonymous confessions page. Also, the possibility that they aren't even the real OP just gives everything an air of mystery.

Meta posts (like this one) have a real range in quality. Anything that slanders Tyga San is immediately trash in my mind, but good suggestions or observations of the page are welcome.

D: Eating Clubs (not including genuine discussion), FAQ Questions

Nobody cares which Eating Club you think is best or has the most delicious food.

I'm glad Tyga started putting the questions together in one post (which must take a decent bit of time), because FAQ questions can be overwhelming. These range from genuine questions that only students can answer to things that could be very easily Googled. For that reason, it makes this pretty hard to rank.

F: Cw: gross, Edgy-to-a-fault, Horny Jail

Anything with a cw: gross leaves me with a bad feeling in my stomach. Sometimes these are clever, but more often I wish they would substitute some graphic descriptions for more nuance.

For what I mean by edgy-to-a-fault jokes, see #33510.

Nobody needs to know what you'd like to do to Kermit the Frog or whoever, you belong in Horny Jail.

I've literally burst into tears because a friend brought me my favorite snacks when I was sad. Being a responsive and interactive ear to vent to is honestly really nice. But if there are things to do, it's nice to just go ahead and offer.

Well let me know if I can do anything"", like well you could offer to do some of the small stuff, but now it feels rude for me to ask you to do it and the offer feels disingenuous.

- The Frist piano was closed when it was discovered that a group of squirrels run an acorn dealership out of it. The admin won’t stop them because regulating squirrel capitalism would count as a political stance.

- If you break the social contract they make you major in social sciences. 

- The marriage pact is actually binding. If you aren’t married to your match by the time you graduate, you forfeit your soul to Jeff Bezos. It was in the terms and conditions.

- The dining hall food is bad because the university made a deal with local businesses - they increase the number of customers in return for a share of the profits. The businesses that didn’t agree get advertised in Zage emails to make sure nobody ever goes there. 

- The person who dropped cake into a covid test bin is likely from the secret cult of math majors. They call themselves the Dihedral Group and even Eisgruber bows down to them. The only reason they haven’t achieved world domination is because it would be so easy they can’t be bothered to actually do it.

- Bicker doesn't determine eating club membership, it's just a distraction. They only care about your writing seminar essays. This is also why they make everyone take writing seminar. A little-known secret is that you can get into any club you want by making all your word counts prime numbers.

- The people loudly hanging out outside from 1-2am? Covid vampires. Don’t make eye contact under any circumstances. If you do, get the vaccine within 48 hours. Otherwise you will turn into one of them, and then the only thing you can eat or drink is the blue liquid from the test kits.

- Profs can see when you’ve opened things on Canvas - if you look at an assignment more than 12 hours before it’s due you get added to The List. Your time management skills have been deemed worthy of a time traveller. On December 5, 2038, everyone on The List is sent to a uniformly random time from the past 3.8 billion years. Good luck.

3/4/2021 23:25:05,"tl;dr - is it just to break up with someone you love, and who loves you back, to save them from yourself.

My girlfriend and I have been in love for a very long time. We have talked about kids, making our different careers paths work for each other post-graduation, our willingness to make sacrifices for the relationship, and we know each other on basically an atomic level. Honestly, without any reservation or irony, I can say she and I fit each other like puzzle pieces. We complete each other, and we have never failed to be there for each other. It is magic. 
But I know I am going to die spiritually. It happens to every man in my family. They start to build a life and family, gain trust on a fundamental level, make everyone feel confident enough to rely on them and bet on them - and then they buckle. I can already feel it happening. Maybe I will crash not too soon out of college. I'll turn into myself, refuse to let anyone in, and live within my own shadow. I'll push her away and force her to carry the household alone while I weep, but by this point we'll already be so enmeshed and combined, financially and emotionally, she'll feel she's stuck with me. Or maybe she will have the will to separate from me, saving herself but damaging herself significantly in the process. 
She loves me too much, and I need to tell her it's a mistake, that the best thing she can do is be as far away as possible from me. I know she won't do it on her own. I have to break up with her, send her away, save her from my inevitable self-destruction. It'll destroy her, and probably shock the fuck out of her, but what else can I do? I know I am a time bomb. I just know it. I am my father, and I know how that goes. ",33736,

What helped me was buying a vibrator (I got a dildo too but that didn't do it for me). Try to get a nice rechargable one if you can (although those are $50 dollars so you could start out cheaper). Something with a silicone/rubbery cap is better than a plastic bullet imo. This is how I had my first orgasm, and while I still haven't orgasmed without a sex toy, it makes me feel a ton better to know ""I can"" (and it's very fun). ",33753,

3/5/2021 11:40:43,"Re @33674- hey, OP- I just wanna start by saying you are so not alone, this is so normal, and you are not in any way broken or less than just because you’ve never had an orgasm. That being said- you are totally capable of it if it’s something you’d like to pursue. I’d recommend really being open to experimenting and seeing what you like- it can be so different for every person. If you have the means, maybe get a few toys, even a super cheap back massager like from CVS or a removable shower head can help do the trick! Be open to porn, or erotica which might help get you in the mindset- but most of all be patient with yourself. Achieving orgasm is a mental game, and if you’re too stressed that it’s taking too long or won’t ever happen it probably won’t. Sex alone or with a partner is supposed to be fun, so just do what feels good and be open to trying new things when you’re comfortable with them. It took me months to figure out how to make myself climax, but it’s so worth it! Knowing your own body can be so empowring. I’m really rooting for you, OP!!",,33753

TwoXsex on reddit has some good posts about female masturbation. dont expect to cum with a partner if you dont know what feels good, it certainly can and does happen, but it is easier to get there with someone else if you get there with yourself first.

Started seeing a cps therapist every other week. I feel like I have a lot of emotional issues I need to solve in order to have a healthy relationship with myself and my s/o. However, I started the sessions because of other reasons and idk how to bring this up. Do you have any tips? I am scared because she thinks I’m doing better (and I am under other aspects) and reduced the frequency of our appointments. I have no idea how to bring these concerns up, but they scare me because they’ll make me end up alone and unloved one day lol

I was also thinking, would share be a good resource to just talk this out? Are there people who I can talk to?

Why are they living rent free in my head? They don't deserve it. I am surrounded by wonderful people who do care about me as a person and do care about my well being, and are there for me when I'm breaking down at 4 am.

We share everything, we know all of each others passwords, crushes, secrets, everything. My twin is on a gap year, and they have been super bored at home and getting really tired of my parents. 

We agreed that we would swap places for a week or two. I would still do all of my schoolwork, go to all of my Zoom classes/meetings, but I'd work from home while they get to have a college social life. I know I know classic “twin swap never works” but it’s not like this is the first time we’ve done something like this. So on Saturday (after they got a negative covid test), they took a mini road trip and we completed the switch. We told our parents that it was just a visit but once I arrived home they knew immediately it was me (which wasn't a surprise). They didn't really care because they know my twin is going through it, so all's good there.

It's only been two days, and the plan is already going sideways. The only person we told is my suitemate so not even my other close friends know. (I know that's kind of shitty but I really wanted to help my twin and the more people we tell the trickier it gets.) But my twin told me that one of my friends is already noticing that something is up. To make matters worse, there have been several incidents where my twin had to pretend their phone was broken because they didn't know about texts/calls I was getting.

Now the icing on the cake... my twin tripped yesterday and has a very noticeable cut. So now we have to wait at least several days until that's resolved or else it will be abundantly clear that we switched.

What do we do? Do I just tell my close friends and switch back asap? Do we ride it out til the cut isn't visible? Has anyone else been in a similar situation before?",33932,

You plan on having a lowkey night, so after abstaining from food and drink for half an hour, you take care of your saliva test and go down to the res college lobby to drop off your sample. When you get there, there's a cute guy dropping off his sample. You feel like you've seen him before, but you can't place how you know him. You find yourself staring a bit too long.

""Hey!"" he says, jolting you out of your daydream. ""I think you meant to drop off your covid test right?"" You're startled. ""Huh?"" you ask. He responds with a chuckle, ""oh I was just saying it seems like you dropped off something else in the bin but maybe I'm wrong.""

You reach into your hoodie pocket to see that you're covid test is still there, but your DHall chocolate cake isn't. ""Oh shit thank you so much!"" You're red in the face. It doesn't matter that you have a mask on; you know he can tell. You drop off your actual covid test in the bin and prepare to sprint walk away, hoping to forget the whole thing. But as he's leaving, he turns around.

I own a waterproof one and just take it into the shower with me for cleaning. For non-motorized, I usually don’t give a fuck and just clean it lol. If you’re embarrassed, go late at night/early in the morning when you’re alone in the bathroom. I also recommend buying wipes so that you can wipe it a little as you wait to properly wash it (a body safe spray works similarly). 
Also, this one I haven’t tried, but since most motorized sex toys only require some light washing with neutral soap, you could wash it in your own room with two bowls (one with soap and the other for rinsing). 
Idk I still recommend not giving a shit tho lmao",33940,

I have a big aversion to therapy because I hate the idea of opening up to strangers about my personal problems and life, but I've been trying to bite the bullet and be super open in my first meeting. I thought I found a therapist that I really liked. There was one thing about him that kinda irked me, but overall he was great. He even made a point to say that I can email him whenever I need to and that he will respond within a day or two. Well I tried emailing because I haven't had time to make an actual appointment and actually needed him to send documentation to my PCP and fill out paperwork. It took him an entire week to respond, he didn't really address any of the struggles I detailed in my email, and just told me to schedule an appt despite me saying that in the email how busy I was and how difficult it is for me to find any time to make an appt with him. I followed up in another email and it's been over a week with no response. I just feel super unheard and dismissed. And now I'm even more anxious because I really regret ever opening up to him. I had another therapist that I liked better, but she's not equipped to deal with my ADHD and you have to schedule like a month out with her. I really don't want to see him again after that email interaction. I don't feel like I can trust that he cares or even listens. Looking back, the thing that irked me was his comment about me growing up with only sisters; he gave the dumb ""oh I feel sorry for your dad, girls are so much drama"" and proceeded later in the session when I was talking about emotional abuse I had undergone from relationship trouble a few years back to say ""see girls and all that drama"". So now I'm thinking that he just thinks I'm being overly dramatic, but I am literally so depressed and anxious right now to the point where I am having daily panic attacks and I feel like I can't turn to anyone and can tell that I'm engaging in really bad self harming behaviors like not eating or drinking, not taking pain meds when needed, etc.",34000,

I've been feeling isolated from other people as of late, so on the advice of folks who have told me to reach out more, here it is: I am reaching out!

That's right, I want to socialize, not just with people I know well in my life, but with anyone! Whether you know of me and want to get to know me, or if we've talked a bit before but have since fallen off, or if you've never even thought of me but want to talk with someone new; here is a chance. There are a lot of posts with people who don't know where to start with meeting new people, so here's a place that you could! I also consider myself reasonably good at connecting people (no algorithm needed baybee), if you're looking for other people to socialize with too.

This offer is open to anyone, on or off campus. The list of things that I would be down to do includes, but is not limited to: casual conversation over messenger, a chill zoom call while we're both studying, a walk to get a hot or cold beverage, really intense conversations where you're seeking advice or just someone to vent to, anything!

If you'd like to chat/schedule a hang-out, please DM me (add me as a friend first)!

And if you're just scrolling by thinking ""ugh, Leahy taking up space per the norm,"" yep you got me there, sorry bout that! But regardless, I hope everyone is doing well, and finding ways to take care of yourself. The world is quite an awful place, but you can make it through - I believe in you. Best of luck with midterms!

I don’t think they really enjoy being around me and I feel they don’t make an effort to see or hang out with me— even tho they do with other friends who aren’t me. and when I am around them, I find it difficult to even talk or socialize (sometimes I feel talked over or not-talked-to), and it just seems everyone is super close with each other but that I don’t have anyone. (to be clear I have close friends who mean the whole entire world to me but I don’t get to see them like everyday/am not living with them atm.) I’m just feeling super lost and confused in this situation especially since I’d’ve never imagined I’d feel this around these people before. so I’m making this post to ask if this is relatable to anyone. does anyone have advice for how I should talk about this with the friends (or even if I should?). I’m really averse to because I’m afraid it would be hurtful especially since part of it’s definitely my fault, it’s a feedback loop of not feeling 100% comfortable with someone -> I consciously hang out with them less -> I feel less comfortable in future. or like, what are some ways people deal with this? I know talking to completely new people is one way but that’s really scary and everyone (me included I should go study) has midterms. hanging out with friends who do make me happy and comfortable and affirmed/complimented is another thing, which I did the other day and it completely made my night, but I can’t do that constantly/don’t want to be needy/need to actually solve this because I’m living with these people for the foreseeable future. help.",34071,

3/10/2021 13:12:36,"PSA: I've seen a lot of misinformation around GPA because people are misinterpreting the Daily Prince article about grades awarded within majors (linked here: https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/01/the-decline-and-fall-of-grade-deflation?fbclid=IwAR3_Ge-u8bj4iHoo8WXUwiTFuKqT0eaPMj-X72V6XQCKTrg57OlCjQ0KvGs) and thought that I should clarify something.

""Grades awarded"" is NOT the same thing as ""Grades of the people in that major"" and does NOT necessarily mean that it's strictly easier to get a good grade if you're in one department over another. The GPAs listed for each department are the average of each grade given out in all of those classes over a course of 3 years. They are NOT the average GPAs of people graduating from those majors.

For example, according to the diagram, the average grade awarded for the math department is a 3.25. This doesn't mean that the average math major has a GPA of 3.25. In fact, most of the math majors I know have 3.8 or above. The reason why MAT has such a low GPA-awarded is because tons of non-math majors take classes like MAT100, MAT 102, MAT 103, MAT 104, MAT 201, MAT 202 and receive relatively low grades. ",34095,

3/10/2021 23:51:40,"Y'all want a spicy confession about a club on campus? Let me entertain you for a moment. I am going to tell you about a club on this campus that I do not think should exist in its (presumed) current state.

Freshman year, I felt lonely and had no friends. So I signed up to help staff Princeton Model Congress because I would get to miss class and hopefully meet some people and be in Washington DC for a few days. I had no experience doing this before and didn't do it in high school. I was told it would be easy and we'd have training, yada yada. And it was, to be honest.

Going on the trip I still was alone because I knew nobody there. I managed to befriend one of my roommates who happened to live where some of my family did, and he was pretty cool and gave me advice (he was a senior at the time). But otherwise I didn't *really* make any new friends, as frosh seemed to have signed up with friends and stuck together, and upperclassmen seemed to already know each other and be part of the whig-clio clique.

The actual event itself, while I am sure that the organizers put countless hours of effort into it to pull it off (and honestly all things considered it is a lot of work), is somewhat of a joke and not taken entirely seriously. Almost all the high schools in attendance are elite, private schools full of wealthy kids. The actual costs these schools pay is exorbitant.

A non-insignificant portion of the staffers including one of my two roommates, in the year I went, did not give two craps about the event. It was basically an excuse to party in a hotel for two nights. Even though I know the organizers worked hard to set everything up, it still felt a little haphazard in many respects -- things were definitely being done on the fly, so to speak. Many people drank excessively until 3am or even later each night. The head organizers of the event organized these parties. One of the nights they had a ""toga party"" and people wore their hotel bathrobes + undies as clothing. They sent a couple photos of people at the parties on the official staffer groupme (as well as planning the party on it too). I looked back on the groupme, and people openly know this and joke about how it's just an excuse to party. People shared pictures from previous years, including from when a fire alarm went off and people had to go outside at like 2am wasted or something. Someone even shared this satirical article from Harvard about Harvard's version of this club, in fact: https://satirev.org/harvard/harvard-model-congress-member-appalled-discover-organization-has-educational-mission#.Wl5CuainE2w=

This alone might not be an issue, but over the three days I got to know the kids in my group decently well. Four or five of them, who were seniors in hs, told me that ""you are no doubt the best moderator I've ever had"" because most of the time staffers are hung over or show up late, or even drunk, or that they didn't bother to learn the rules and didn't apply them fairly (remember this was the first time I had ever done something like this, it was not hard at all!). It was clear the students knew that many of the staffers did not care about them very much. One of the kids told me he had gone twice previously and he never felt like the staffers were there for the right reasons. On the last day, they told me some of their classmates had at the event their moderators not show up, presumably because they stayed up late at night partying. Also on the last day a few kids were moved into my group when some other group had an issue because the person supposed to be moderating it didn't show up.

All in all, I, or you, might not really care about this too much. But I was shocked to learn later that this event brings in five-figures of profit for Whig Clio. In my memory, I remember them saying between 20k-30k per year -- it could be higher, maybe lower. I don't totally remember. According to their website, they only charged $30 per delegate during the covid semester, but using the wayback machine I found that the earlybird registration used to be 110 and then 150 for the normal price, *per student*. The website says roughly 1,000 students attend. This is six-figure revenue, folks. Over $100,000 passes through their hands. Admittedly, the wayback machine didn't go back to the year I went, but I expect those numbers to be consistent.

Maybe newer students and those in charge take it more seriously today. I don't know. None of this might apply any more. But other than getting to work with the very smart students, which was nice, It was so unfulfilling to be there because I didn't know it was just an excuse to party going in. It just seems so wrong to me that one of the most privileged clubs on campus in terms of administrative support, institutional strength, and visibility gets to siphon off enormous amounts of money from elite schools and does/did so by partying and (like I said, other than the organizers who 100% put a lot of effort into this) not really caring about why they were there. Something about that doesn't sit right with me, especially given the wonkiness and inequity that clubs on this campus are treated depending how new they are and what types of activities they do because of the ODUS/whoever regulations. I'm glad they give kids, even if they are ones who already have privileged educations, a chance to have a good experience and activity, but it felt so ingenuine and profiteering in hindsight, even though the staffers with me were nice and full of good spirits -- pun intended. I know literally nothing about how it's run today (as you can imagine I never interacted with Whig Clio events again after that!), but if it's anything like it was when I went as a first year, I don't think it deserves to continue operating as-is. It felt like ""I went to a fancy high school and did this type of event so now it's my turn to party on their dime for a weekend,"" or it felt like ""I'm here because I'm buddy buddy with the Whig Clio folks, we're gonna go have fun.""

Again I don't want this to be seen as some condemnation of all of Whig Clio, I know a ton of really awesome people in it and it's a huge organization that does lots of different stuff, but I do want to share it because I think it demonstrates how, depending on your clubs and activities on campus, it gives you different access to a social scene and ability to avoid the rules and stuff like that, and how much money it generates for Whig Clio -- though like I said I'm not certain on the numbers, but I know it's a lot. Clearly this problem extends beyond Princeton's model congress given the Harvard satirical article,  and maybe there are even other events or clubs on campus that are similar, but we at least can be marginally better than them.

Additionally, I don't want to say everyone who goes or even goes just to party is a bad person either. Looking back on the groupme it surprised me when I saw names that I now recognized: people who I would meet later and become friends with. Many people went because they clearly knew it was a chance to party in DC and didn't think the actual running of the event was that important -- presumably because the understood subtext of the event is, to an extent, exactly that.

At the end of the day though, it annoys me that a club can make that much money breaking that many ODUS rules and not giving a wholehearted effort to an event with high schoolers at it. Other clubs get scraps and get FBI and cop ODUS but yall get ""I pretend I do not see it"" ODUS and get trashed on an all-expense paid trip to DC and still make bank.",34146,

Also, if Princeton did this, everyone would cook their own food or go to WaWa since those options are cheaper, not to mention the possibility that some people wouldn’t eat a healthy amount in order to save money. So this would result in Princeton having to pay for (almost, or at least very many more) every meal swipe, and that’d be pretty silly (Yes, there is a huge endowment. No, you aren’t supposed to spend massive amounts of an endowment. It’s like a life savings account, not a rainy day fund.). However I do agree that the meals this year are shitty.

it is so sickening to see a bunch of men complaining about ""sweeping generalizations"" to the extent that it makes it ABOUT THEM as opposed to about the women (ALL women) who literally have to constantly worry about getting killed or harmed at any point in time because of men. YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM!!!!!!

If you dont want it to be ALL MEN, FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT PLEASE!!! stop making it about your feelings and consider the societal issues that you can ally yourself with women against in order to create a safer environment for everyone.

I'm an international student who went home for remote learning, and as a result of the time zone difference I've had to wake up much earlier than the rest of my family, in particular my sister who I share a bed with (small house with very little space and a lot of people).

Every morning I have to wake up anywhere from 3-6 hours before my sister gets up. I have a couple classes where my grades are borderline failing, and I really need to go to office hours then to get the help that I need to carry on. My sister is a light sleeper so I often end up waking her, no matter how quiet, slow moving, etc... I try to be. I do try quite hard to not wake her up. I usually end up spending 30-45 min just trying to get out of the bed and leave the room, where all of my clothes and other things for school are outside. 

I've tried all kinds of things: silent alarms, vibrating wrist watch alarms, trying to convince her to wear ear plugs or use a white noise machine, etc... I've also tried sleeping elsewhere in my house, but there is not enough space to fit me, and usually when I am going to sleep my family occupies these spaces and makes a lot of noise. 

My sister has become increasingly upset from being woken up, and I wake up every morning in fear of the yelling and screaming that will occur. If anyone has any advice or suggestions, I would like to hear them. I'm very desperate for something, anything, that will work.",34228,

There are plenty of people who are trying their best to have a nice social life but they can't under these circumstances. If you can have a social life you're happy with, even if it's not the most ideal in terms of meeting new people, just go for it. Plus, next semester, there are going to be tons of people coming back from gap years, moving back onto campus, and frosh, all looking to make new friends!

It's like as females we're conditioned to feel shame about our sexuality, be covert with how we deal with people sexually and romantically, yet objectified in mass media (as well as by ourselves) and then gaslighted for having these human urges. I'm not defending Miley for all her actions nor attributing the source of these contradictions to all men, but wouldn't it be nice to live in a world where we can be our free sexual selves but not obsessively make that all that we are?

Her SO demands so much from her and guilts her whenever she doesn’t pay attention to them 24/7, even when she’s just trying to do homework. It’s gotten to the point where she’s scared they’ll try to hurt or kill themself if she doesn’t spend enough time with them during the day. Meanwhile, the SO never seems to check in on her when she’s having a rough day or care that she’s always anxious and sleep-deprived because of them. They expect all this emotional labor from her, and they haven’t even begun to reciprocate.

I totally get what it’s like to care so much about someone that you’ll do whatever it takes to make them happy. The problem is, I can’t shake the feeling that my friend is being used and mistreated in a big way. I don’t know what to do about it - she has no intention of breaking up with them anytime soon, and the last time she tried to talk to her SO about setting boundaries, they just used their mental health to manipulate her again by saying the conversation made them felt attacked, unloved, and suicidal. Who knows what they’d threaten if she actually tried to criticize their behavior or end their relationship. Any advice would be appreciated, because my friend deserves a million times better than this. It infuriates me to tears to watch my friend go through this and feel so powerless to stop it, and I’m also scared things will only get worse over time.",34427,

3/17/2021 15:26:56,"Reply to 34453. Hey! I’m replying by confession since I don’t feel comfortable publicly talking about this, but what you said is similar to my experience. I’m probably ace, too! I don’t know for sure since I’ve never had a romantic relationship (and have no idea how to get into one), maybe I would enjoy sex with the right person. But whenever I think about what sex would be like, even with someone I find cute and who I care about, I feel disinterest and vague icky feelings albeit not strong repulsion. Honestly just cuddling and having interesting conversations and spending quality time together would make me happier in a relationship than sex would (I’m interested in romance up to cuddling but not making out or sex). 

I haven’t talked about this stuff with friends either, since sadly it’s an awkward topic for me and others (it shouldn’t be ofc, but it is). Also like you, none of my friends seem obviously ace (I think it’d be easy for someone who knows me decently well to guess I’m ace), but you’ll never know until you ask! It’s incredibly easy for someone’s sexuality to not be obvious. That’s even more true of ace because sadly it’s normalized that everyone wants sex/romance.

Also, I would definitely feel weird using LGBT Center resources or getting into queer communities. Maybe those things are technically for me, but I think I understand myself pretty well without help, and honesty like you said “just doing my own thing” is pretty great for me. I feel best leaving those resources to people who actually need them, or their sexuality is a more important part of themselves. Like, being (probably) ace is a part of me I’ve noticed, but it doesn’t really matter that much to me, and I don’t think I really care about my sexuality— “ambivalent towards sex” describes me well. I don’t feel like a part of a GRSM community, and I’m fine just vibing by myself and not worrying about this since it doesn’t affect my life. No one knows I’m ace, I’m not dating anyone right now, so it doesn’t matter. But I think I do want to date someone so maybe I will start caring about this a lot more soon lol.

I’m well aware that being able to not care about my sexuality is because people don’t hate me for this part of myself, as opposed to gay or trans people, and if being ace is a stronger part of your identity, OP, then that’s great and I support you! Nothing I wrote here applies to people who aren’t me, ofc. I’ve been fortunate enough to not really encounter stupidity like “don’t knock [sex] until you try it” or similarly hurtful stuff directed towards ace people, which also contributes to me caring less. If someone said something like that in response to explaining you’re ace, the correct response is “go fuck yourself, because I definitely am not going to!” by the way. I don’t know about actual advice if you encounter crap like this for being ace, since thankfully I have no experience with it, but just know that you’re valid and that, even if I weren’t ace, it makes a lot of sense to me that someone could be ace! Like, if I were a sex beast, I would enjoy this thing a lot, but okay cool, other people might not enjoy or even dislike the stuff I love, since that is true of every hobby. Conversely, it makes a lot less sense to me that someone wouldn’t be ace, though! Like, bruh, have you ever thought about it and realized that sex is just objectively weird? I mean in terms of how it works biologically and in a “why would I think to do that” sense, I know that sex (and actually having kids) can make people really happy and fulfilled, but it makes no sense why this weirdly specific physical interaction should do that.

It would be nice to have someone to talk to about this stuff! I wish there were a way for us to non-publicly figure out who we are so that we could. Maybe if you want to do so, you can reply to this post, and I can make a random new gmail account and we can message that way lol.",34514,

(to paraphrase another post from here) breaking up with your SO to fuck your friend/for someone else is bad if this was an exclusive relationship, where you aren’t supposed to be pursuing others romantically by definition. making plans to fuck your friend/go after someone else while you’re in the relationship pretty clearly goes against that agreement.

3/18/2021 1:33:15,"There is quite a disparity between the media coverage and social media posts regarding the Atlanta shooting. As a Chinese American, something I am trying to wrap my head around is how and why different groups are pushing different narratives about the motive of the crime, primarily whether it should be race-centric or gender-centric (or both). NYT/WSJ/The Washington Post/the ""news"" tends to take a more neutral approach and is hesitant to state the crime was racially motivated (it should be noted that regardless of intent - the affected community was Asian so at the very least this crime was systemically racist but intention is still up in the air given that the shooter denied racial motivations and victims were not solely Asian). On the other hand, social media has generally argued that this was an Asian hate crime which is certainly understandable given that 6 of the deaths were Asian women (but as mentioned above, arguments have been made that this situation is not so black and white). This whole situation and the rising trend in hate crimes (against Asians) is obviously terrible and no person, regardless of identity, should have to endure this. 

My question/what I am trying to understand therefore is how I/people should reconcile the narratives and more importantly, not only ""take action"" for the Asian community but ALL people regardless of identity who face/may face similar situations. I should note that I am not trying to take a dogmatic view of the situation (unlike some social media or news outlets...) and instead am trying to turn this motivation into something that will move all communities forward (not just the ones that are in the ""spotlight""). I should note my overall bias in being wary of social media channels in general (whether it be Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) I am also inclined to think most social media posters do not take the time to thoroughly understand the situation or engage their critical thinking skills (I do not claim I do either of course. Learning is an ongiong process) which is understandably hard to do an emotionally charged time so I do not necessarily find fault but regardless there may be negative consequences.  

A related thought/observation is that many of the social media posts (not just in this event but in general) tend to be EXCLUSIVE rather than INCLUSIVE (in addition to being overly simplistic especially with regard to history/policy and being superficial like BLM posts - particularly the blackout posts...). Many posts offer suggestions for how people can support Asian American organizations, highlight awareness-building quotes from Asian social media/Twitter accounts (although a few too many give me the ""YASSS queen"" snap vibe which well....), etc. While this is mostly great, I would like to also point out how a blind eye has been turned to more general/inclusive actions like advocating for better gun prevention, domestic violence services, etc. which would benefit EVERYONE not just Asians. A point of contention that has not been addressed is why the other victims of the shooting, not just the two white women but the other men/women who were injured in the shooting, have not received the same attention or - for a lack of a better term - been used as political/activist leverage. (I feel that some social media accounts/politicians/activists/etc. - particularly those from Asian backgrounds - may be ""hogging"" the narrative and using this event to push their own agenda). This is not to say that we shouldn't focus on Asians but that rather perhaps it would be more meaningful and sustainable to build off of intersectional identities/groups as opposed to specific identities. It feels like every race/group is fighting for themselves as opposed to working together. I should note that intersectional work is certainly happening but that I feel like social media has become a lot more compartmentalized in a bad way that promotes counterproductive ""tribalism""/shortsightedness (""Asians suffer these problems. Here's how you can help them."" On the other hand XYZ group suffers these problems. Here's how you can help them."" When in reality all the groups are affected.... ).

There are some of the thoughts that I have and I was just looking for a place to share them since I don't really get the opportunity to do it a lot sadly but yeah. I sincerely appreciate anyone who takes the time/energy to respond to this post and share their thoughts, especially if you are of the Asian community - it's not always an easy thing to do.

First of all why would this be something anyone would be proud of ever, secondly why would you be so blatantly belittling your ex by basically saying they weren't attractive enough to do it for you.... idk, I personally think OP #2 got what they deserved and should probably chew on those regrets for a little while, but the vibes of the two posts are different. To me recognizing you've fucked up is already 50% of the way towards forgiveness, and op#1 showed 0% remorse about (i) hurting their ex and (ii) using someone for sex based solely on their physical appearance.  ",34558,

He ended up surprising me from Day 1, recognizing me from some emails to listservs, being quite responsive (even saying at some point ""sorry for the late reply, I was taking a midterm"". I remember actually being lukewarm about him at first just b/c I'd been into another guy from Tinder, but eventually talked to him more and ended up enjoying our flirting and long convos. We even chatted outside late at night, and he'd invited me to hang out another time (although that ended up falling through). 

He made it clear he didn't intend to date anytime soon b/c he was busy, and I was fine with that (and assured him as much), and tbf he did have a busy term, and he would still respond to my messages fairly often (and would even flirt occasionally), but recently, I found when I asked to meet up (outside), from the nature of his refusals, it felt like he was making excuses (which I found confusing since initially he asked to hang out), but he'd still be responsive and occasionally even continue convos by sending me something random on his end. And at some point he said ""if I wasn't slammed with classes and so busy, I'd take you on a date"" so I figured he was at least somewhat into me. But today, he asked (again, he had in the past) about other guys I'd met on apps, and was giving me flirting advice about one of them, and so I asked if he was friendzoning me and he was like ""nah, but I'm just not dateable"" and said he worked too much for a relationship and probably would keep doing so for a while (which again, I was fine with that and was fine with rolling with an unrequited crush), but I guess I felt snubbed that he suddenly never wanted to hang out anymore (and damn me for getting attached enough to want to see him this badly). 

And the thing is he was still so incredibly nice (I ended up ranting about STEM workaholics in academia even after he said ""I'm flattered you hate ppl like me in academia"" and he just listened and tried to be reassuring and uplifting), and he said that he was an introvert who enjoyed company ""on occasion"" and that COVID had basically gutted even that (although again, I'm just confused now b/c he'd initiated the first hangout and had asked to hang out once more after that), and UGH why am I so lame and pathetic, obviously this guy wants nothing to do with me and I should let it go UGH. But I really did take quite a liking to him....he just had kept pleasantly surprising me repeatedly (like offering to hang out on my bday when I had asked him if he'd be free, even though he had tons of exams, although now I'm wondering if that was just an excuse — he did push off potential hangouts until (his) spring break, then mentioned one of those weekends he'd visit family, etc.), and so I think I just feel hurt that he seems to never want to see me for some reason.

It was halftime and really loud music was playing and some old person walked in front of me and my group of friends making really huge eccentric arm and hand movements and I started laughing and doing a crazy dance, because I really thought they were just being silly. I then found out that person had an illness (I forget what it’s called) and causes random uncontrollable spasms and things. I felt so so bad bc I’m sure they saw me and obviously thought I was making fun of them. So I told my friend, sometimes you might not even be aware that something you do it hurtful and then when you learn it is, it’s important what you do after that. She was just so angry at me for what I did and said she doesn’t see me the same way anymore.. she said I was old enough to know the difference between a dance and muscle spasms and I should have gone to apologize and that I still caused harm to that person so she would not have forgiven me. I think she’s overreacting but I guess I could be wrong. I really did think they were just being silly and fun and I really didn’t mean harm, and I felt so bad about it but I was too nervous as a young kid to go up to an adult stranger and start talking (and I don’t think I would have even been allowed to go alone) idk what do y’all think??",34646,

""Oh c'mon"" says mathematician #1 ""do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? Just play along""

""There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn't serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.""

""But that's not a problem"" mathematician #3 chimes in ""at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-""

""I know how limits work"" interjects the bartender  ""Oh, alright then. I didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics""

""Are you kidding me?"" The bartender replies, ""you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?"" 

""HE'S ON TO US"" mathematician #1 screeches 

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.  The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""FOOLS"" it booms in unison, ""I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA""

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish. 

A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. ""How did you know that that would work?"" 

""It's simple really"" the bartender says. ""I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.""",34654,

3/19/2021 17:52:54,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind takes place in the same universe as Castle in the Sky, but in the far future. The most obvious clue to this is that the squirrel-fox animals appear in both movies-- Nausicaa has one as a pet, and the gardener robot looks after some of them in Castle in the Sky. Also, in the final showdown between Muska and Sheeta and Pazu, Sheeta tells Muska about a poem from her valley that mentions living with the earth and wind, a reference to Nausicaa's home. You could pass these off as just easter eggs, but I think it actually fits really well if these movies are related. In the opening credits to Castle in the Sky, we see very many castles in the sky, and if Laputa survived, it stands to reason other castles did too. There are tons of people in the world who are like Muska, and as technology advanced, I find it totally believable that humans took control of some of these castles-- and their super weapons. These weapons helped cause the Seven Days of Fire described in Nausicaa, and the giant warriors who also played a part look similar to the robots from Castle in the Sky. The robots and the giant warriors also appear to have a similar process of death, where after their purpose is complete they fade into the earth and slowly become places for growing things to root (compare the robots who died leaving the gardener robot alone, and the skulls of giant warriors that Nausicaa explores). Maybe I am being very silly, but it all seems to fit!",34656,

3/22/2021 21:27:22,"my s/o and I had a conversation late thursday about a topic I wasn't completely comfortable with but was still actively participating in. afterwards i texted her that i was feeling a bit overwhelmed and needed to clear my thoughts. the next day she said she wasn't feeling well and didn't want to talk, which i respected. i texted her telling her to feel better and apologized for being a nervous wreck/saying we didn't have to talk about the thing we were talking about. i have anxiety issues and  I tend to over-apologize because i always worry i've hurt someone's feelings.

then saturday night she called me. i had a really bad friday and saturday and wasn't super talkative. she tried to start a few conversations but I was pretty quiet, which happens when I'm depressed. then, she got frustrated, and said i had guilted her by being overly anxious/apologetic. she said i was trying to make her feel bad by being wishy-washy about the conversation on thursday and then the followup texts on friday.

i immediately acknowledged her grievances because I didn't want to be combative, and also because if she felt hurt because I was something I had said i needed to take responsibility for that. but honestly i was just paralyzed (this happens when I have to face conflict) and din't know what to say, and i wasn't able to express my full feelings about how much she meant to me.  i also feel like maybe she misread my messages, but i didn't want to gaslight her by questioning her reading of them because whatever i said clearly hurt her.

and then she said we should stop talking.

i really love her and I still think she's the coolest. she hasn't unfollowed me on any social media, but I noticed that she updated her dating profile slightly (we met on an app). I want to reach out to her to see if we can work through this, and at the very least I want to be friends (because she is cool).

we've only been together a couple months and have never had any fights. even friday and saturday (saturday is when she basically dumped me) she kept sending me insta and twitter memes. i thought everything would be okay. now it feels like a rug has been pulled out from under my feet and my whole world is falling apart. 

writing a confession about it is cathartic. but does anyone have advice on what to do? :( i want her to know that i really love her. ive made an appointment with a therapist as well to help me with my anxiety issues, which have been going on for some time. she suggested i have issues with communication, and that they won't change overnight. but i want to show her that i want to work towards communicating better, and something like seeing a therapist would also be a sign to her that im taking it seriously. and even if we can't get back together, how do i signal that im sorry for hurting her? :(",34790,

I'm an Asian American female who just came out as bi to her friends! I still haven't come out to my parents who are super super traditional and would probably flip and try to convince me that I am 100% straight. Honestly, I probably will never come out to my family unless I get a girlfriend since I'm so scared of their reaction. Family is so important to me and I constantly worry that this will ruin my relationship with them. I 100% understand where you are coming from with staying in the closet. When I first came out, my close group of friends were super supportive and that gave me a confidence boost to come out to more people. I tried to keep the mindset that ""if they weren't supportive then they probably weren't people I wanted around anyways"" but it gets complicated with family for me personally. I've been raised that family is forever and being confronted with a situation that I might be judged and lose that love is fucking terrifying. 

I'm sorry that you are facing this painful situation and I'm sorry I don't have a solution for you op.

For the most part, I feel like being on campus has helped my eating disorder. I haven’t purged in a long time and I feel like a fuller person whose worth is determined by so many other factors again, not just photos and zoom. 
But lately I have been binging sooo sooo sooo much and I so badly about it after but in the moment I tell myself I deserve food and restricting isn’t great (because of course that’s the other side of an ED I struggle with) and now I’m not restricting much and getting good meals but binging so often especially at night and it’s partially to relive stress and partially a habit and partially because I’m mad I did it and then I do it to comfort myself again and it’s a vicious cycle and I wish I could purge.... but I won’t! But I currently am unable to exercise right now and that makes me feel even worse...
Im also really really scared to go home for the summer. My family and food/diet/body image was awful at home I got to a pretty dark point and had a lot of struggles with eating, and I don’t want to regress to that again, now that I know internships won’t be in person and I will probably be there.

If you can turn your tongue upside-down, you can actually demonstrate this with two different senses: touch and proprioception. Turn your tongue upside-down, then touch one side of it with your finger. It will feel like you touched the other side. You can also move your finger left and right and where you feel it touching will move in the opposite direction.

He represents our fears, but instead of repressing them he acknowledges them and chooses to fight them. In his own way, though not for everybody, he wants the world to be a better place, and fights with the utmost passion to do so. Is he a nice guy, fuck no he's an asshole. However, he believes in the truth, and his voice needs to be heard and he really does want he believes is fair. Sure his actions can be excessive, but inside there is a part of everyone which really does want some limited revenge and wants to see a change. After the trauma he endured in that fight, and the fact that he never wants people to have to endure that again, and becomes even stronger is very admirable in my opinion. Sure if Floch was in real life, I would not be friends with him but I immensely respect his loyalty and I do believe he is a rational thinker and a very realistic character. Please start showing Floch more respect, and remember this ode to our king. He represents a part of us that we all refuse to acknowledge and please be grateful for that.

3/27/2021 18:07:04,"cw: rant

Being at home this last semester at Princeton I've realized how horrible this whole rat race was now that I'm coming out of it. Now when an aunt comes asking about their kid about ""what extracurriculars should they do to get into Princeton"" or ""is having them take 7 APs"" enough"" I feel so disgusted even though I know five years ago I was in that same position.

So now I tell them that their priorities are misaligned, that schools are getting rid of standarduzed testing and looking at applications more holistically, and instead of taking solace in what would rightfully deescalate the pressure cooker kids go through these days, the aunt is like ""ohh I see how it is they're changing it up so we need to find new ways to game the system.""

ugh I always tell the kids that ""look up to me"" from my home town to just aim for the state college, that the quality will be just as good if not better than this place with all of its hype. But as jaded as I am, can I really say that the Princeton name didn't get a second look from people scanning my resume? I honestly do not think I learned anything here I couldn't have figured out on my own with some willful wikipedia wizardry, but I can't lie that Princeton ultimately sells prestige, and I guess someone coming in FLI I never realized how stupidly overpowered and intoxicating prestige can be.

So yeah. It's like a zero sum game. No it's a negative sum game, society as a whole is worse off IMO with degree and prestige inflation, and we see that in mental illness reporting among youth. It's the red queen hypothesis and mutually assured destruction rolled into one, and I guess I'm glad that getting an education here at least informed me of how overhyped it really is.",35085,

3/27/2021 18:29:59,"cw: sexual harassment

something that's been really bothering me lately is this very specific internalized sexism that makes me feel flattered when I get catcalled or leered at on the street, and makes me feel bad about myself that it doesn't happen to me very often, as if that's a reflection on my attractiveness- even though i KNOW street harassment is fundamentally about excluding women from public spaces. But still when other women talk about their experiences with street harassment i get perversely jealous on some level that it doesn't happen to me more. And of course I'd never express that to anyone because the few times men have made me feel unsafe in public spaces i know how shitty it was and i would never want to trivialize other people's experiences with that just because of my own internalized misogyny (also because the very fact that it doesn't happen to me more is probably related to my own race/class privilege). 
Has anyone else ever had these kind of thoughts, and if so do you have any advice for working past them? 
I'm just having a hard time getting what i KNOW to be true (""catcalling is a form of sexual harassment that makes public spaces unsafe for women"") to replace what i FEEL as a result of internalized sexism (""i need to be attractive to men and being catcalled is a sign that i've achieved that goal"")",35087,

3/28/2021 1:18:23,"hi everyone. this is a PSA mainly for my fellow indian-americans but everyone is welcome to read:

recently a cousin of mine, a visible sikh, was harassed, called slurs, and attacked by a small group of men while walking home. based on the things they said to him, he said they seemed to be proponents of hindutva as the slurs they called him are directly connected to that ideology.

for those of you that don’t know, hindutva/hindu nationalism has been rapidly growing in india, particular after the rise of modi and his party, the bjp, to power. while hindus are 80% of india’s population, this has had massive ramifications for the other 20% of indians.

around this time last year, pogroms in delhi, india’s capital, claimed the lives of many muslims and many others were attacked, raped, or had their property destroyed. while muslims have borne the brunt of hindutva rage, christians have also reported increased harassment and assault and, since the farmers’ protests began, sikhs have also experienced harassment and assault.

this is slowly spreading beyond india into other countries. hate crimes and rhetoric against sikhs and muslims have greatly increased in australia and, if my cousin is anything to go by, it’s now spreading to america too.

the reason i bring this up is because according to surveys done on indian-americans, many, particularly first-generation immigrants, show strong support for modi, the bjp, and often times hindutva as well. for many of you, these could be your parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.

i am humbly asking my hindu friends not as a sikh, but as one indian-american to other indian-americans, please, please initiate dialogues with your family or spread awareness regarding what is going on. your non-hindu indian friends are begging you.",35107,

I'm not really sure why, but two and a half weeks ago I decided to stop masturbating (male). Usually every night I would do it before bed. I never really thought much of it but it made me just like overall hornier as a person, I think. It became like a natural cycle where I had conditioned myself to getting off once a day. I would think about sex a lot too (and how I am not getting any xd). But ever since I just randomly decided to stop, I feel like I've like weirdly gained more control over my life. I go to bed earlier and sleep more now, and in general I'm way less horny, which has made me feel less lonely for being single as well, and as a consequence I feel like my mood has improved, though that definitely also has something to do with the weather getting better. 

Anyway, I feel so weird for having my life improve this way. It's like I found some secret life hack. Kinda like George Costanza in that one episode. Maybe I should cross post this with chaste right wing TC lol. So if you're a guy as I am and feel lonely and horny a lot, try cutting it out of your life, because it somehow has worked for me.

3/29/2021 0:29:29,"With course registration fast approaching, I thought it'd be helpful to compile list of a few courses which I consider must-takes!

GSS100 -  Intro to Not Being a Chauvinist Asshole
This class would be very helpful for a lot of TC commenters! It explores important questions such as: ""maybe we should call women... women?"" and ""could it be that sometimes men are wrong?"" For your final exam, you will have to write one paragraph in praise of a woman, but here's the kicker: you can't compliment her looks! This course is definitely not an easy A, but if you're up for the challenge, you may learn a lot.

MUS201 - Slightly Less Terrible Music to Blare in your Room
A lot of us here love to blare music in our rooms, after all, it's not like headphones exist! So when it's a Tuesday at 11:30 pm and you're getting ready to put your speaker on full volume, be confident that your music will only ~slightly~ piss off your neighbors. This course will be an interactive way of evaluating music choices and getting you ready to serenade your neighbors with the least-awful music possible. Do note however that PHI107 - Ethics of Communal Bathroom Music is a prerequisite.

THR103 - Acting Like You Care
Whether it's showing up to a precept unprepared or listening to someone talking about fishing for hours on end, we all have to pretend to care more than we really do sometimes. If you want help improving your acting skills, the theater department is here to help! The final project is a tough one. You'll be thrown into an awkward interaction with someone you secretly hate. They'll ask you if you want to grab lunch sometime, to which you'll have to respond in a way that leaves them thinking you'd love to while also creating no actual plans to meet with them.",35173,

3/29/2021 8:05:42,"This is the most anime I've watched in one season in a long time, so I decided to review them.

New shows

Mushoku Tensei - 2/10. This anime would be infinitely better if the MC wasn't such a scumbag. There is some interesting worldbuilding and some interesting side characters and the show hints at an interesting plot in the future, but all of this is completely drowned out by how awful the main character is.

Horimiya - 6/10 (there's still one episode yet to come out but w/e). This is not great as a romcom because there is so little comedy. This is not great as a romantic drama because the stakes are too low. There are too many side characters that don't do anything. In these ways, it feels very similar to Oregairu, which I did not like. However, unlike Oregairu, this is at least DECENT as a pure romance show. I read the manga a while ago and liked it more; the emotional moments hit the mark, and the comedy was better (as far as I remember). So if you like Oregairu then you'll like this show, and if you didn't you should just read the manga if it looks interesting.


Old shows, new seasons

Yuru Camp 2 - ?/10 (put on hold after 3 episodes) (I gave s1 a 7/10). I haven't really been in the right mindset to enjoy this kind of show, so instead of being calming, it was just kinda boring. But I'll probably return to this one some other time.

Quintessential Quintuplets 2 - 5/10 (I gave s1 a 3/10). A definite improvement over the first season. However, I don't really like any of the girls and REALLY don't like the MC, sooo....

Dr. Stone 2 - 7/10 (I gave s1 a 6/10). This show is slowly turning into over-the-top shounen trash and I am ten billion percent on board. But anyway the big difference compared to the first season is the pacing; this season gets to the point a lot quicker.

Beastars 2 - 8/10 (I gave s1 a 9/10). Definitely worse than the first season in a lot of ways, but still a fantastic and underrated show. Just impeccable worldbuilding and attention to detail, and Legoshi is one of my favorite characters of all time.

Attack on Titan 4 - 10/10 (I gave s1, s2, s3, and s3p2 a 4/10, 5/10, 8/10, and 9/10, respectively). AoT just keeps getting better. Did you like all the politics, mystery, and high stakes action of season 3? This is a lot more of that, and it's even better than before. Create interesting characters, set them on a collision course, and watch the sparks fly. Awesome.


Old shows

Kaiji - 2/10 (dropped after 9 episodes). Why do people like this show? It is so slow and the mindgames stuff is worse than like every other mindgames-type show (Death Note, Death Parade, etc.). I stuck it out to the end of the first arc but I have no interest in watching more.

Usually I watch more old shows but this season was really stacked.",35189,

The school also offers so many internship opportunities and means of support. It’s also easy to get classes that we want. At other schools it’s difficult to get into a class, but here even if a class is full we can always email someone and usually it works out.

3/29/2021 23:18:17,"I think it's time to talk about how horrible this University treats people who get Honor Coded. The process is literally so de-humanizing. From getting a random email one day saying you got Honor Coded in a class and not getting a single clue what the accusation is about until you get grilled by an investigative team the VERY same day (and sometimes late at night). They literally ask you to retrace every step you made and then get suspicious when you aren't confident in what you say (how the hell am I supposed to remember every little detail of some random day on the spot?!). If your case gets moved to a trial (which they don't tell you immediately after the meeting), you have to spend the next days/weeks/month building a case for yourself (even though at that point the professor/accuser and investigators pretty much have it set in their mind that you did it). Oh, and let's talk about how you're told to reach out to CPS if you're feeling depressed/anxious. Literally f*ck you. Hell yeah I'm angry and anxious because you're accusing me of something I didn't do and barely giving me the benefit of the doubt. CPS is not gonna f*cking help me. And I don't necessarily blame the Honor Committee members, but I do think they do contribute to this horrible system by being a part of it. I think this has more to do with University policies and how the Honor Code is set up. I could have been suspended for an entire year and gotten my financial aid revoked for the semesters I would have to make up. My family doesn't even make 1/4 of Princeton's tuition. And the fact that people have pushed to change it in the past and the University gave them big middle finger is f*cked up.

3/30/2021 0:11:14,"Follow-up to #35189 (anime reviews):

- In my rating scale, a 5/10 is watchable and a 6/10 is enjoyable. 4 and below are shows that are not worth watching and 7 and above are shows that I would recommend to other people. The median and mode score I give out is a 6; the mean is about a 5.7. So keep that in mind; my ratings are not really comparable to MAL (and for this reason, I don't have a MAL and just keep track of this stuff in a spreadsheet).

- About Mushoku Tensei: Shows should speak for themselves. If you have to explain why I should like a show, then it isn't a good show. The most important question is ""did I enjoy it?"" and for Mushoku Tensei the answer for me was ""not at all.""

- About Quints: Okay, I lied; I actually do like Itsuki. But she's pretty much not in the running right now. Ichika is literally evil, Nino is kind of a psychopath, Miku and Yotsuba are respectively too quiet/gloomy and too loud/bubbly. Itsuki hits a nice balance.

- About Oregairu and Horimiya: I gave the first season of Oregairu a 5/10 and the second a 2/10. I have not watched the third season and do not plan to. Both Horimiya and Oregairu kinda suck at both comedy and drama. The difference with Horimiya (why it has a higher score) is that Horimiya has decent romance but Oregairu sucks at that, too, at least in what I've seen.

But there are many, many other romance shows I've seen that either are better than Horimiya or are equally good but offer more variety than ""it's high school."" In no particular order: Nodame Cantabile, Takagi-san, Toradora, Aobuta, Nozaki-kun, Kokoro Connect, Kaguya-sama, Wotakoi, Tada-kun, Sakura-sou, Rent-a-Girlfriend, Shirayuki-hime, Tonikawa.

- I did not watch Jujutsu Kaisen. I have seen Hunter x Hunter and gave it an 8; it would be higher if the show wasn't so gd long. I watched the first season and a half of MHA before getting bored, and gave it a 6.

To continue the conversation about the word ""female"", it's important to note that this word is used a lot in the incel community, a community which literally HATES WOMEN. Example: let's look at Elliot Rogers (the self-identified incel who is also a mass murderer). His 141 page manifesto has the word ""female"" 31 times in it, while the word ""woman"" is there only 12 times. In those 12 times, he is mainly speaking about his mother and his four nannies (women he did not sexualize), or just the concept of women as in ""when and a man and a woman"" or, when he says stuff like, and I directly quote, ""women are all mentally ill"" (here he was saying his mom is no exception). 

On the other hand, when he uses ""female"" it's a lot more specifically about women he sexualizes, and the language is very dehumanizing like others have said. He uses it about real women that he sees on the streets or that pass him by. Whether subconscious or not, he is giving the women in his life a different level of humanity, and this is determined by the usage of ""female"" vs ""woman"". 

(As an aside, ""girl"" is used 540 times and usually inside of the word ""girlfriend"") 

I know this is an extreme example, but the incel community as a whole uses this language, and when I hear it, I remember this usage and how it is implemented to promote violence whether it is verbal or physical (to me, incels are a hate group). ""Females"" reduces us to solely sexual beings and this not only objectifies us, but is also exclusionary. 

At the same time, I do say female friend to distinguish from girlfriend, and I think that's fine, but,

tl;dr just using ""females"" is weird at best, violent at worst.

Also, TC is generally pretty saturated with complaints that Princeton, especially during the pandemic, has created an environment with unrealistic academic standards and abysmal mental-health outcomes for many students. I wish there were some way that people could take this survey anonymously, but I wonder what percentage of Princeton students actually complete 4 years without ever ""committing"" any honor-code violation of any sort. They teach us about Game Theory in every POL/SPIA/ECON course, yet they give us closed-book exams to take online during a pandemic as if general principles of psychology don't apply to us because we are so moral. It seems like the administration is obsessed with the idea and prestige of an honor code, demanding we ""pledge our honor"" like we are fucking Knights, but does not actually support us to reasonably do so. It's funny because at the end of the day this University is just a hedge fund built with money from the most evil people to ever live in human history that happens to offer some classes and research opportunities so they can avoid paying taxes.",35337,

In the link https://ibb.co/6sKJVZT is a screenshot of a game that I just won (essentially a once-in-a lifetime opportunity for me so winning was nice while it lasted haha). The game came down to the two boxes in the upper-left corner (both on the top row) the flag and the 3, and the game score said one bomb was left unflagged. It was a 50/50 shot that I guessed that the bomb was the box all the way in the left corner, when I was then able to reveal the 3 immediately to the right of it. 

So my question is: is there a way that I could have made this call with certainty? I was thinking that the game w/ equal probability could have been a bomb in the 3 space and a ""1"" in the farthest-left corner.

Hi I REALLY don't want to make you feel worse and I know I inherently can't understand what you're going through, but making sure everyone's testing perfectly on schedule is the only way the university can make sure people don't spread covid and KILL others. We all signed a contract obligating us to do this. You can ask them to give you enough kits for the rest of the semester so you don't have to pick them up, do the tests as a ritual after you brush your teeth, if you don't have time do it while you're watching lecture or something. We can submit them up to 24 hours before they're picked up now so you can do them any time.
I get that you're unwell and it makes things harder--I've been there before. But you have responsibilities as a student on campus, and demonizing the university for trying to enforce health standards to prevent DEATH is not cool.",35379,

4/1/2021 11:01:56,"Should I tell this to my other roommates? 

I live in one of the annexes on campus with a few other residents. The bathroom (on the second floor) is built such that one end of it projects out of the house. We have been aware that the house is a bit on the older side and so water spills from the shower isn't good for the strength of the floor. To top this, I know that one of my roommates is in the habit of literally jumping out of the shower.

Well, if you can't already guess here goes: I was reading in my room and heard a loud thud (first on the second floor bathroom), then a sound of breaking furniture, and then a yell ""Oh Gawwwwwd!!"". I think heard the source of the voice moved from the second floor to the first floor (there was some Doppler effect to it as well). And finally another thud outside the house on the street. A couple of minutes later the door bell rang and there he was (using a leaf) asking me to look away as I opened the door.  

What I think happened:  My roommate, as usual, jumped out of the shower. The floor gave away. It broke under his feet and he fell through the floor (butt naked), onto the shade of the porch, rolled over and fell onto the street outside.  He has, since then, requested me to not tell this to the others. I have promised him I won't. But I feel almost impossible to hold back the incident from my other roommates. ",35435,

4/1/2021 12:26:53,"Seeing the influx of posts recently about people being screwed over by the Honor Committee reminded me of this question I've always had: am I alone in feeling that there is some sort of taboo around talking about getting Honor Coded? I was among those falsely accused of cheating in the MAT202 kerfuffle last year, and ever since I had my charges dismissed (side note, they canceled my hearing the night before it was scheduled to happen due to a lack of evidence) I had always wanted to share my experiences to anyone who wanted advice, who wanted to commiserate with someone who had also been fucked over, who wanted another reason to vent about this school's terrible bureaucracy, etc. However, I keep feeling like there is this unwritten rule that one should never mention that an event like this had happened to them? There is a rule that one shouldn't discuss the incident with Princeton students before the hearing takes place, which I understand, but they didn't bother telling me this rule until a few days after I received the email saying I had been reported. By then I had already posted a panicked IG story asking Princeton students wtf to do when I had received a random Honor Code violation out of nowhere that was met by crickets (this detail outs my identity to the people who know me, I don't even care anymore). The only people I had for support at the time were my DSL, my parents, and my boyfriend (who doesn't go to Princeton). Among those people, my DSL was the only one who was able to fully understand the details of my case by merit of his job and knowledge of the Princeton Honor Committee, and while he was very supportive and kind throughout the entire process, it was nevertheless still extremely isolating to not be able to talk to Princeton peers. It's a no-brainer that processes like these absolutely devastate one's mental health (mild pun intended?).

While the real number is a mystery, the rumors suggest that there are at least dozens of people who had been victimized by MAT202 and that most of them got off without consequences (assuming due to innocence), but I don't know who any of these people are. Is there a rule that I'm not aware of that prevents them from speaking out, or is it all individual fear? Unlike what Simon Rosen said in his honor code story, I was never explicitly told to not talk about the incident after the fact (apparently even that can't really stop anyone, either). Are people afraid of the stigma, even if they were innocent of the charge, since there's always going to be people who say ""Oh you MUST have done something shady if you were accused of anything at all""? Is there some school rule I'm not privy to? I feel that the status quo keeps students who have been fucked by the Honor Committee separate and unaware of each other, in a way preventing unionization (but as the referenda from two years ago have proved, it's not like a united student body would have any effect if the University doesn't want them to). The taboo around speaking out also dehumanizes people who have been reported to the Honor Committee, since the general Princetonian public never finds out who the people behind the statistics are. Not even including those snide comments from boomers willfully ignoring/in full support of a system that presumes guilt until proven innocent saying that we spoiled brats deserve whatever was coming for us by merit of having been reported at all, even hearing our fellow students and the Princetonian media debate and discuss us, a wide diversity of students with different circumstances, with vague adjectives and characterizations was very objectifying. 

I'm very worried that a lack of regular discussion creates a vicious cycle of the unfairness of the Honor Code system resurfacing every spring, everyone going through the same song and dance of debating what those wily cheaters deserve to have happen to them or not, and forgetting by the time summer arrives. While these strange virtual times have created more discussion about the ethics of the Honor Code, I still firmly believe that as long as victims of the system remain a dehumanized mass of moral failing, as long as every year a new class of students gets kicked to the curb with little to no resources to turn to or acknowledgement/guidance from those who had come before them, as long as Princeton students, faculty, staff, and alumni still cling to their assumptions of who they think we are, never having to look living, breathing humans in the eye in order to tell us that we deserve to undergo this draconian process - nothing will change.

In the dream, we dated, fucked, talked into each others souls, cried when I had to leave, and she comforted me when I broke in anguish, distraught about how I had violated my SO's trust and screwed over our perfect life. I woke up with piercing guilt and debilitating confusion. It felt like there was a cinderblock on my chest, and when I tried to breathe it just got heavier. My SO called to say goodmorning, and of course they did because we talk every day and have plans to spend the rest of our lives together and have been starstruck by each other for years.

I have no clue why, but for some reason since i was little I’ve always thought that I was never meant to grow old. as in, I fully expected that I’d be caught in some horrible accident in my mid 20s or 30s and die a tragically young death, leaving behind everything I've worked for and loved until then. I don't idolize death, but I don't particularly fear it either. And I've never been and will not ever be suicidal. But whenever I try to picture what the future looks like, in 40 or 50 years, i can't picture anything at all - it's just blank. I know it's probably just because it's hard to picture that stuff when you're in college anyway, but why does my mind automatically turn to death as the only logical reason? I'm constantly thinking, maybe one day I'll cross a road unsuspectingly and it's all over from there. Crossing a road now? Oh maybe this is the one. I dunno. It's not an all consuming fear or anything, but I don't know why my mind is so preoccupied with death in the first place. Maybe it's a way of guilting myself into having the best life now, while I still can? But I'm not really having the best life - otherwise you'd think I'd be traveling the world or something. Anyway these are just weird thoughts that have been bugging my mind for a while, and I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this. But don't worry about me, I'm doing just fine :)",35579,

 I’ve locked myself in my room trying to figure out what’s going on and what’s going to happen next. Long story short, I don’t think we’re in the ‘Princeton’ anymore. Here’s your last chance to scroll to the next post before you can’t go back... 

Maybe it’s that week 9 faded malaise, but this week just felt... off. It was only looking back and thinking about it that I realized just how bizarre things were. First off, the lights. I know someone already brought this up in TC, but the light that I saw was coming from north of blair hall. The light was flickering in pulses every for about 30 seconds then stopped and did not begin again. I heard several other people witness the same FLASHES in different areas all north campus. Maybe it was the screen on the lax field, but still a bit odd. Next we’re the alarms. Both an alarm in butler at 4am on Sunday night/Monday morning and the north of campus at 2-3am on Tuesday. Then there are the bizarre incidences on the south side of campus. I was jogging on the tow path when I noticed the smell of fire. It was April first and I saw across the lake a random massive tree engulfed in flames. The temp wasn’t extreme and I think we had rain just a day before? Many fire trucks arrived within minutes and sirens lasted a while. About 20 minutes later on my way down the tow path still 3 low flying military looking helicopters hovered above very slowly then proceeded to head up campus. Odd occurrences to say the least but here’s what really got me questioning what is going on in this town. I was in my dorm building and was hanging out planning some l things with my friend until about Midnight. I entered an elevator by myself at floor 3 and when I got on I immediately pressed 2(my floor). I started looking at a meme on instagram but I realized after like 30 seconds that I wasn’t moving. When I looked up, though, I was on floor 4. The doors never opened, I never heard or felt any movement, and yet I had moved up a floor. I quickly just pressed 2 again and fortunately got there. I sped walk back to my room freaking out and tried to shake off the experience, but for about 5 minutes after I felt incredibly disassociated from reality and scared as fuck.

It has to be done carefully and with open acknowledgement that it's for rhetorical and educational purposes, but adopting a devil's advocate for awful ideas is justified so long as those ideas are still widespread. We have to know how to argue against racism to stop it, especially since those pushing racism couch it in coded language. Otherwise, those on the other side (who are numerous and won't stop existing anytime soon) won't change their ways and hold their leaders accountable.

4/6/2021 11:42:46,"I had a friend who I met in high school, and she was one of the nicest, most charismatic people I've ever met. Unfortunately, she was only in my area for about a year because her family moved around often, but perhaps as a result she had a superpower of being able to make friends anywhere and everywhere - just looking at our mutual friends on social media showed some people I'd never expect her to have met and befriended. Though we didn't keep in touch often, I considered us good friends on good terms with each other, having been close enough to have deeper discussions about religion and personal struggles.

I bring her up because recently my mom was interested in a summer camp for my brother she had only heard of in passing, and this old high school classmate was the only person she knew who had participated in it. My mom asked me to get in contact with this classmate in order to get the name of the program and some basic information about it, and based on past interactions with her I assumed she'd happily oblige. By now, she has amassed a decently-sized following through ""Ivy League College content"" (she doesn't go to Princeton BTW). When I reached out to say hi and ask about the summer camp, she wouldn't reply for days at a time and kept dodging my questions. I'm not going to assume anything about her texting habits, her availability, or what she might be going through, but that hurt like a bitch. Her entire image online revolves around positive traits I had known her for previously: cheerfulness, accessibility, and caring about everyone around her. Ironically, the more people she pushed the ""I'm everybody's friend!"" character to, the more distant she became. It really stung to see someone who makes posts and stories all the time saying ""you are loved"" and ""I'm here for everyone who needs mental and emotional support, anyone can DM me"" refuse to answer a question as innocuous as ""what was that one summer camp you went to that one year"".

This was mainly a rant to reflect on the trappings and effects of even modest levels of fame. I commonly hear stories of people being told by friends and family ""Don't forget me when you're famous"" when they achieve something big. The sentiment I have, and can assume most of my Princeton peers have, towards phrases like that is a slight uneasiness: after all, having received great opportunities did not fundamentally change who I am, yet I'm being othered for them. However, this experience really showed me that ""forgetting your friends when you're famous"" is absolutely a thing and hurts more than people let on, especially if their fame is derived from supposedly being such a good friend.",35806,

Here's my take on students on the Honor Committee. Maybe you joined for honorable reasons, but the facts remain that you are enforcers and executors of a pre-determined policy. There is no meaningful changing it from within. 

Rather, your presence on the Honor Committee allows the University to justify insanely draconian punishments because it's ""student-led"" etc. etc. If you all really cared about abolishing the insanity of this system, you would resign en masse. After such a humiliation, the University would be forced to genuinely reform its policies to match what other schools do.

To those who say, ""if not me, then somebody else will do it"" - this is the attitude that has kept numerous regimes' secret polices staffed throughout history, and it does not exonerate you. If you really cared about us, you would all resign together. The fact that you continue to refuse to do so shows that you are complicit in what the university does to its students.",35815,

So I just watched the last 2 episodes of AoT S1, and I think they're super relevant for the direction it's gonna go in with Eren and why he seems to have become antagonistic. During his fight with Annie, Annie first beats him to a bloody pulp, but then he regains his strength and his Attack Titan takes on a form with black skin and burning fire/plasma where its veins are. First of all, what even is that special titan form and how can Eren access it? Is it just a differing appearance, like how at the end of the Marley assault Reiner had a bunch of random spikes on his body, or is it something more? While Eren is in this form, he talks in a different, deeper voice, and he talks about wanting to destroy the entire world, even back then. I wonder how much of that is Eren talking and how much of it is the entity that is the Attack Titan talking. I have no idea what Eren's plan is now, but if anything, I'd guess he wants to activate the Rumbling and destroy the world so that Eldians can finally be free, and the Attack Titan-- whose whole shtick is pushing forward for freedom (Eren says ""I am free,"" unsure how much I believe him)-- would totally have that as *its* goal. But what's Eren's goal? Does it align completely with the Attack Titan's goal, and what about the War Hammer and Founder influencing him, too? Also, when he's in bed after the Annie fight and Mikasa is taking care of him, Eren tells her that he enjoyed the fighting and getting beaten up, even, but doesn't have thoughts of enjoying it now that he's out of his titan form. And while he's saying this, you can see that his eyes glow blue-green for a second, just like (but less noticeable) when he transformed in front of Reiner and Falco in Liberio. I predict that someone will comment on this telling me to read the manga, by the way. :P",35896,

I have regular meetings with CPS. I will bring this up with my counsellor later this week. I need to rant. Also if you recognise me in this pls do not tag me. Thank you. 

I am so burnt out that the one subject, my major, that I wholly love and want to pursue graduate school in, is now giving me NO joy. Zero. Zilch. Nada. My purpose in life - this one subject and research - is now tiring me out. 

What scared me tonight was when I thought, for a brief second, that now that I have no aspirations anymore, and I’m loosing interest in what I considered my purpose, letting go would feel nice. I, for a smidge of a second, contemplated the relief I’d gain through self destruction. 

I need help. I don’t want to be convinced that relief from my own self (because I hate how I chide myself for not attending lecture or slacking off) through suicide is the true form of detachment. I’m not convinced now and I’ll keep fighting that voice in my head telling me it’s the easiest thing to do, but please tell me whom I can talk to to get this out of my head.

4/8/2021 9:12:40,"My SO (not a Princeton student) and I had a pretty normal relationship, didn't fight often and were generally quite in love with each other. Last weekend we were just as usual, talked about the future and it felt great. On Tuesday, he was feeling very bad and I went to his house because he told me he wanted to spend time with me because he was feeling sad. We walked back home and he started crying, I tried to remind him how awesome he was but he kept sitting down what I said. It hurt so much to watch him be so sad that my voice started cracking. We came home and I had noticed that whatever I said wasn't working,so I tried to tell him I would just listen. He answered ""listen to what, to my stupid s***?"" and he threw some stuff around. I was like of scared at this point, I know he would never harm me, but it was so sudden it was shocking. Then I tried hugging him, but he asked me not to touch him so I didn't. Then he suddenly asked me to leave because I was just being dumb and useless, but this was already around 12 am and not only was I worried for him because he was punching stuff, but I didn't want to go home alone at that time.
So I stay and in the morning it was raining and he just told me to get an uber. I asked him if I could hug him and said OK, I did, said I love you when I left and he didn't even reply. Later on in the day, he told me he couldn't be with someone who was so weak that wouldn't lift him up when he was down, and I have no clue what is wrong with what I did. I literally tried everything I could think of. I told him that sometimes, we're so sad that no matter what people do, we feel sad, and that's OK! But he started comparing me to his ex girlfriend from when he was 17 (mind you he's 25+now) and said how she motivated him so much when he was down, and said I just sound like a fake script. I asked him how I could improve and he said he didn't know and he said I don't bring out the best in him and don't motivate him to do better in his work. I have literally changed my sleep schedule to better accommodate his, have helped him with some legal issues, supported him throughout... I feel like this came out of the blue and it feels so unfair that he would judge my worth as a partner for not being able to know this was a problem when he hadn't even mentioned it before, and not even receive an apology for pinching stuff and throwing things around, but somehow my voice cracking was the problem, because I guess I can't feel empathy or have feelings that show. He has already told me not to cry in these situations because he thinks it is manipulative, so I didn't do that. Now I'm so sad and broken, I don't even know if he's breaking up with me or not. And what makes me angrier is that I offered to ""improve and learn"" rather than demand an apology... I hate how easily I let people that I love walk all over me. ",35936,

But noooo, somehow we can do 4 covid tests in two weeks but definitely not ONE brain scan in that same time??

4/8/2021 22:34:11,"There’s probably a lot of giveaways in this post, but part of me is too tired to care anymore.

I’m tired of “getting through” the latest challenge in life only to have a newer, harder one waiting for me. I got through all of high school with my mom screaming down my back about how I’d be a failure if I didn’t get into a “good” university while taking care of my brother. I’ve almost made it through four years of Princeton and dealt with staying at home and taking on all the responsibilities I did back in high school—and then some, because my parents have gotten worse and worse. I got through my roommates this semester claiming to care about my safety and despite a talk where boundaries where clearly states, they kept on pushing these boundaries and placing me in such uncomfortable positions I could barely sleep for the week before I moved out. 

Just last week, again, I couldn’t sleep at all because of all the fights/things that have been going on at home or because of pure emotional distress. Since the pandemic, I’ve barely been able to focus at home due to the constant fights and last week was the culmination of my parent’s eight years of neglect. This past week has been such a struggle and all this responsibility to make sure my brother is at least getting out of bed and eating is chipping away at me—and worst of all is that my parents still don’t understand. My sister isn’t any help because she keeps making demands for me to help with her homework or cook for her. I can’t focus and it’s so hard for me to summon the energy for anything, especially this past week, but if I don’t continue then what of my siblings? 

I’ve reached the point where I don’t even want to tell anyone anything anymore. There’s no way my friends can help and I just feel guilty for burdening them with listening to my problems. And I just feel awful because what is there that can be done? 

I’m so sick of this, even if I do “get through” this hurdle what’s next? Another hurdle that’s just as hard, if not harder? What if I don’t want to get through things anymore. What’s the point when life just keeps hurling all this at me and my already small will to live keeps getting sucked dry. Existence is such a pain, I don’t know why I’m trying or why I’ve been trying.",35991,

What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it? What happens then? If when he knows me, he's only disappointed? What if I give myself away to only get it given back? I couldn't live with that. How do you live with that? So, I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind. This way I get the best view. So that when he sees me, I want him to. I'm not defensive! I'm simply being cautious. I can't risk reckless dating due to my miscalculating while a certain suitor stands in line. I've seen in movies most made for television, you cannot be too careful when it comes to sharing your life. I could end up a miserable wife. Sorry girls, but he could be criminal, some sort of psychopath who escaped from an institution somewhere where they don't have girls. He could have masterminded some way to find me. He could be colorblind. How untrustworthy is that? He could be less than kind or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes and make me laugh, come out of hiding. What do I do with that? Oh, god what if when he sees me I like him and he knows it? What if he opens up a door and I can't close it? What if a door is opened? What happens then? If when he holds me my heart is set in motion. I'm not prepared for that. I'm scared of breaking open but still I can't help from hoping to find someone to talk to who likes the way I am. Someone who when he sees me, wants to again",35999,

4/9/2021 0:51:59,"It is 12:52 A.M., Eastern, on Thursday night (Okay, Friday morning). And all I can hear are the 15 or so people in the lower Whitman Courtyard who are physically incapable of shutting the hell up for literally any amount of time. I kid you not, this shit sounds like a pickup basketball game, or some sort of street performance. It sounds like the audio you would hear on a Barstool Sports Instagram video of white men doing something stupid on a boat on a lake -- periodic ""OHHHHH""s, always a not-so-dull roar of chatter interspersed with fratty laughs, and, at any moment when there is only one individual speaking the voice is always speaking at a low yell. There's randomly the occasional ""WHOOO!"" like a girl would make flashing guys, also on a boat in the middle of a lake. It's clearly mostly men, though women are present too. The sound reverberates off the stone exterior in the courtyard into your room. I genuinely thought the window wasn't shut in my room because that shit was so loud. It's been like this for roughly an hour and a half. 

I'm not asking, I demand to know what group of Princeton students, in this economy, in this semester, could possibly have the free time (no way they're all PTL) to be doing this. What in oblivion gave you the audacity to possibly think hanging out chilling with people was a good idea 1) on a school night, 2) after quiet hours (11:00 on school night, 1:00 on a weekend, right?), 3) literally in the dead center of where no fewer than 100? 200? people live? 

At this point, I'm not even upset anymore. I just cannot fathom how anyone does this, at this hour, in this semester, on this day of the week, in this location. Quite literally, go anywhere else. I don't really care what you do, have some fun, but how on earth did you think it wise to pick the *center of a res college*? Use ya head, fools.",36004,

I had no idea she was on a drug and wasn’t sober. She called me and told me come over. When I got to her place, it was just her and her friend and we went up to her room and started making out. Then, we had sex. Throughout the entire time, she made all of the first moves and demonstrated enthusiastic consent. I had no idea she wasn’t sober. I thought she was just really into the sex. I found out she was fucked up after we finished and she told me she was high. The next day was totally normal and we chatted on the phone and she seemed fine.

back at it again
because i need an outlet
and the void needs screaming into:

it’s no fun 
playing games
with an opponent who is 
no Match.

i hate that i play them,
because it makes me feel
Fucking Crazy,
but every time i think to fold,
you remind me why i rolled the dice first. 

i hate that i play them
but it’s a toxic default—
just waiting for you to care
for a single moment. 

so i stop. 
i stop and wait for you to notice—
wait for you to recognize that 
something is missing.
i wait to see if you will file a 
missing persons’ report
for our friendship; 
i search through rows of 
milk cartons, 
scanning for a sign
of us on the side of one. 

(this is imagery i’ve actually 
only read about in books
so i don’t know if that’s 
entirely how it goes).

i am exhausted from 
giving so much more 
than you do.

but even when i withdraw
you don’t seem to notice,
which makes me wonder: 

is this how you want it to be 
anyways?

rejection is fine,
but apathy, total indifference?
that hurts the most. 

i recognize that eventually
closeness brings 
casualness,
but it still 
hurts watching us become 
a casualty of 
fizzled closeness.

i miss saying things and feeling like they 
mattered to you;
i miss feeling like i 
matter to you.

if not words of affirmation, 
nor acts of service,
nor physical touch,
and not quality time,
how do you love? 

do you not love at all—
(which i don’t think is true)
or do you just not love me?

(ugh, not like ~that~ though; chill)

i’m sick of trying 
so hard 
for someone who doesn’t want me—
i miss having my buddy.",36009,

Last time, my little brother was here, told him not to talk to our mom like that, and dad walked up to him like he was gonna fight him. For the first time I felt protective instead of scared and I stepped in between them. I am like 5’5 and skinny and my ‘little’ brother is 6’3 and over 200 pounds, and it’s so interesting to me that I felt a need to protect him, but I feel too scared to go help my little sweet mother? Angry at myself honestly. Maybe I’m just so used to him bullying her that it doesn’t seem urgent or out of place, but the second I thought he was going to hurt my baby brother I just couldn’t. Honestly, in that moment, I wished he would hit me. Because then there would be a real, physical reason not to forgive him.

Rick Harrison IV: Welcome to the Silver Dollar Pawn Shop, what have you got there for us?

My grandson: I haaaveee (fumbling around) an original laminated COVID-19 vaccine card

Chumlee III: Woah man, that's pretty cool

*changes to cutaway*

Rick IV: The COVID-19 pandemic was a huge global event that changed the course of the early 21st century. Medical antiques have a decently sized market, and I know that for the right price I can turn it for a profit.

*back to scene*

Rick: So how'd you get this?

My grandson: My grandpa actually kept it around. And he had it laminated after he got his vaccines, so it's stayed in great shape

Chum: what are you looking to do with it?

Grandson: I'd like to sell this for 300 dollars.

Rick: Look, would you mind if I called someone in to take a look at this? I - it's just - I know they made a lot of fakes of these things back in the day, and technically it's illegal to posses a fraudulent one and -

Grandson: That's no problem

*cutaway to woman walking into the shop*

*cutaway to a close up of the woman*

Fauci: My name is Susan Fauci, and I'm a historian at the Clark County Medical Museum.

*cuts back to the shop*

Fauci: Hey Rick, what've you got for me today?

Rick: This guy says he's got a Covid-19 Vaccine card

Fauci: Ah, nice, let me look.

*inspects the card*

Fauci: So we can see this has the right information -- the Pfizer vaccine codes always have a distinct 3 digit ending, and this matches that. And the CDC logo appears to be in its first rendition, so we're talking about a first edition printing. This is definitely legitimate.

Rick: So... what's it worth?

Fauci: Well, the problem for you is (looks at grandson) these aren't all that rare. A lot of people kept these around -- you gotta remember, nearly everyone in the US had one of these at one point.

*cutaway to Grandson looking concerned*

(off camera) Fauci: But....

*cuts back to Fauci*

Fauci: The quality here is extraordinary. It's really been kept in top shape even over 100 years later. That brings the value up. So if I had to appraise this, I'd give it --

*cutaway to dramatic music, pans over faces of Rick, Chum, Grandson*

Fauci: probably between 200 to 250 dollars.

Rick: Alright, thank's Dr. Fauci

Fauci: No problem, Rick

*she leaves*

Rick: I mean, I'd give you 100 bucks for it.

Grandson: No way, man, how about 200?

Rick: I'll go 150 and not a penny more.

Grandson: 175?

Rick: (crosstalk) not a - not a penny more.

*dramatic music, pans back and forth between Rick, Chum, and Grandson*

Grandson: Alright, you've got a deal

*cutaway to Rick*

Sometimes I’m just chilling on Nassau talking about my life with my non-Princeton friends, and I think about what the Princeton people that pass me are thinking when they overhear me. I was severely abused, neglected, and bullied my whole life. Tried every drug under the sun (besides like crack, meth, and H) in my early 20’s to cope with my sexuality. I was forced into IOP therapy in my early teens and experienced months-long periods of crippling depression many times in my life. This is only the half of it. 
But the thing is, I’m perfectly fine. Somehow, I ended up here and I feel so damn lucky for it. Saying the things I’ve said above is just so nonchalant because it’s all I’ve ever known. I don’t need or want pity.

4/13/2021 17:41:18,"I honestly don’t know what to do and need some advice from y’all. I would like to be on campus this summer. But, my parents are clearly against it.

I will be completely vaccinated when summer comes. (Moderna hottie 🥵) I practice safety by doubling up my masks and cleaning surfaces frequently. I don’t go out and remove my masks at any time. Costs aren’t going to be a problem for me nor my parents. I just need to leave this home.

I’ve been home the entire year. I live with too many people and there’s not enough space. I’ve never had my own room. I have to flash a bright light or yell from desk whenever I have to unmute my mic. When I’m in lectures, I don’t even try to focus because the sound of my mother yelling at my siblings drowns it out. That’s even with noise-cancelling headphones. I’m asked to make all these contributions to my household. I can’t even FaceTime my friends to rant or something because I have no privacy. My academics have taken a hit since COVID. I could give a fuck about a GPA or graduate school. I’m also bothered constantly about my body image. I just can’t be home this summer. I’ve also recently started therapy which I can’t do at home...so I have to make up excuses to go outside. If I mention therapy, I’m sure it’ll turn into an entire conversation I’m not ready to have.

I think it's alright in a genetics/medicine course or something like that, where you are talking about the population in aggregate or the specific impacts of chromosomes independent of socialization (i.e. ""Being male is a risk factor for X disease,"" although more specifics (is it chromosome-based? is it physiological?) would be great.) If I was talking about groups of people in the real world I would lean more towards 'people who menstruate/people with vaginas/people with penises' depending on what the context is that makes it 100% necessary to mention someone's biological sex- but I also don't necessarily see a problem with it being awkward to use because imho people don't really (or shouldn't really) talk about other people's biological sex? I don't mean for this to come across as hostile (it's great that you're asking!) but I firmly believe that someone's gentalia and genetics are the purview of A. their doctor, B. themselves, and C. their sexual partner (if they have/want one).

4/16/2021 19:16:38,"Reply to 36403. Commenters have covered it well, but I just want to add that on two occasions, former friends indicated they did not want to interact with me. One of them told me explicitly through a mutual friend. Another would not reply to texts for weeks or months at a time, finally stopped replying completely, and yet when they would reply or I would see them, we would have mutually enjoyable conversations. They never explicitly said or texted anything remotely about not wanting to see me. I was hurt far, far more by the latter than the former. So please, FUCKING TELL THE PERSON (through someone else if you aren't comfy talking to them directly) if you don't want to be around them, ESPECIALLY if you care about minimizing their pain. It is never not inordinately bold to assume that someone will get your hints no matter how obvious you think you are. Anything less than clearly, explicitly communicating what you want is an epic failure in any sort of relationship.

if someone is into you, they will TELL YOU TO YOUR FACE that they are into you (and if they are into you and do not do this eventually, where eventually is allowed to be an arbitrary amount of time since yes shooting your shot is scary, i'd say you're better off looking elsewhere. good communication is the bedrock of any relationship romantic or not, and if they start out with """"""hints"""""" (which are NOT EVER good communication because people have different interpretations), that increases the probability they are a bad communicator.)

if you want to know if someone considers you ""just a friend"" or a potential SO, do not assume the first one because they fist-bumped you or called you dude or bro. that is STUPID. if you want to know, ASK THEM. if you want to determine if someone is into you, do not assume this is true because you caught them looking at you as a part of some idiotic test. people look at each other when they're with each other, romantic interest or not. if you want to know, FUCKING ASK THEM. 

these games of hints are the dumbest and most infuriating thing ever, and it's so much easier for everyone involved if you use your words like a big person to indicate if you're down. also, it's a lot sexier. someone i like who tells me clearly and confidently exactly what they want out of me? hell yeah, when's our date (assuming i'm okay with what they want of me and they're okay with what i want of them)? someone who only ""tells"" me through hints that i probably cannot understand and should not be expected to understand, because i am not a telepath? nah. that's just frustrating, and doesn't bode well for when high-stakes communication will be important.",36558,

4/17/2021 5:39:17,"@#36403 OP here. You all in the comments do a lot of assuming with so little information. It's baffling. First, you have no idea how clear these hints are. Take it at face value. I have blocked them on some social platforms, but they continue to add me on more or making other accounts. If anything I kept it to myself because that may give it away for them. Second, I think that might be stalking. If I'm asking it's because I don't want to escalate the situation by contacting SHARE or my DSL. A ""just tell them"" could've sufficed, but you had to start taking it personal. Please think before you comment when someone's asking genuine advice. ",36580,

But we’ve both observed that simply bearing conservative ideas is very stigmatized here. It’s also not like there’s a lack of conservative students to promote conversation; it’s just that a lot of them don’t speak up bc of this stigma. I understand that the northeast is more liberal...

Everyone I’ve met respects my decision to not drink, but that usually means I just stay in my room while my friends go get drunk together and make crazy/fun memories together.

I guess my confession here is that I chose to not drink because my dad used to physically and mentally abuse me a lot while he was often drunk whether that was beating me with beer bottles or burning my back with cigarettes. I still deal with those mental and physical scars to this day (e.g. not feeling comfortable taking my shirt off around others and having to play it off as a body weight insecurity). I try to tolerate being around drunk friends, but my heart still races whenever someone drunk gets really close to me or has physical contact with me.

I just feel really conflicted because I’m tired of feeling left out, but the only thing my friends ever want to do for fun is go to get drunk.

4/18/2021 15:49:08,"response to 36536: no one has a moral responsibility to go out of their way to explain to someone why they don't want to be friends with them. There is a reason most people don’t have to have friend break-ups. People either pick up on hints or naturally drift apart. If you can’t pick up on hints then that is not your friend’s responsibility. Perhaps that explains why they don’t want to be friends with you in the first place. Perhaps your conversations weren’t actually that mutually enjoyable. There are so many “friendships” where people are just so self-centered and narcissistic that all they do is just talk about themselves and their own lives and flex or complain about relationship drama and etc. to anyone who will listen to them (bc those ppl are trying to be polite). So you can see very easily how if one party lacks the basic self-awareness to realize when other people aren’t interested in them because all they do is talk about themselves, they might think their relationship is mutually beneficial when it is not. People need to have more self awareness instead of putting the burden on other people to do that work for them. I don’t need an excuse to decide not to expend the emotional labor of detailing why I don’t want to be friends with a person who probably doesn’t want to hear it so that they can maintain delusions about how great they are.

I don't mean specifically not into certain kinks but more like... not into any kind of power play/fantasy/experimentation in the bedroom at all?

We in the Writing Program value the hard work you've put in this semester, and would like to put that work to good use in furthering our teaching mission.

Do you consent to our using of your work in future courses? We would really appreciate the chance to roast the fuck out of your absolutely dogshit clusterfuck of an essay. Your writing will be anonymized as to prevent a public indictment of your embarrassingly poor work. Seriously, are you in fifth grade? Is this satire? Are we being Punk'd? Honest to god, a toddler babbling nonsense would make more persuasive arguments than your random assortment of words and phrases that we're generously calling ""an essay.""

4/19/2021 16:17:40,"tl;dr: pton housing needs to be better for trans ppl
A couple weeks ago, I got really stressed because I realized that not having gender-neutral housing next year will really affect my mental health. I realize almost all housing here is ""gender neutral"" but if you don't have a private bathroom then it isn't really. So I started researching it and it turns out I had to fill out a whole application which was due a week ago at that point. I hadn't even looked at the bathroom accommodation request form because I thought that was for people with disabilities. Anyways so I emailed housing and asked if there's anything I could do to get housing that would accommodate my gender identity and apologized for missing the deadline. I got an email saying my case had been ""opened"" and then one saying it had been ""resolved."" They never said anything to me. Not even ""too late, sorry."" Just nothing. I also reached out to the LGBT center and they didn't reply to me. 
Princeton pretends its housing is trans-inclusive by marking rooms gender-neutral, but if you're actually trans, it's incredibly difficult to get housing that meets your needs. There's no information shared, you have to look for it; deadlines are strict; there's a paper application and an interview required; and if you miss anything, no one will help you or even give you the decency of a reply.

4/20/2021 11:30:33,"Let’s talk about how I feel about my faith! So my mom is a fairly traditional Christian, my dad who is also a Christian is a bit more liberal. I was raised fairly conservatively/traditionally (and believed some of the terrible stuff that goes along with that), but college and high school programs really helped me realize how wrong a lot of my upbringing was. I’d now consider myself a liberal/progressive Christian— for instance, I don’t believe in hell as most Christians view it, because their conception of hell is antithetical to love and kindness. And I don’t think the Bible is 100% literally true, it feels more correct and more useful to me to interpret a lot of it as a parable or myth. But some parts are deeply relevant to how I should behave, the “sheep and goats judgement” often comes to mind, and Jesus’s example and sacrifice makes me a better and kinder person no matter how much of what the Bible says about Him is true. I don’t know exactly what I believe about a lot of stuff, and I bet some people would say I’m not even a Christian for some of the stuff I said and believe. I absolutely believe that a God/afterlife exists, but I have *no idea* how much of Them or the specifics of what They’re like Christianity or any other faith gets correct. This is all just based on what’s essentially my intuition/what feels right by the way. I think I have a really weird set of beliefs on this in general for what it’s worth.

So that’s where I’m coming from faith-background wise. I know who I am and what I believe, and I’m quite happy with it, but problems arise when I try to mesh myself in Christian communities. You see, I’ve never really felt completely comfortable in such communities. Sure, there are lots of individual Christians I’ve met who I love dearly. But I never felt completely part of the group, and so many of the rituals and the language just feels weird and off to me. For example, how it’s said we should view other Christians as siblings, and yeah, I’m never going to be able to do this. My sister, who I’m super close to and love more than pretty much anyone, is my sibling. I cannot and never will view people who I might have no connection to beyond sharing a religious label in the same way that I view my sister. And this isn’t to say I don’t enjoy or love other Christians— again, there are lots of Christians who I love dearly! But they aren’t my siblings. My sister is my sibling, and no one else will ever be my sibling. Maybe you can justify this by saying “it’s a different sort of sibling”, but if that’s the case why use the word? And in the church I grew up in, it’s taught that other Christians *really are* your siblings just like a real sibling. It’s just a bunch of leaps and reaches I’m never going to be able to make. There are lots of other examples of me getting weirded out beyond the siblings example. 

Hell is another one that just makes me super uncomfortable. Some of the best, most loving and kind people I know are atheist/agnostic, and I refuse to believe in anything that results in them spending eternity in pain for no other reason than they don’t believe. It’s just wrong, and I can’t fathom why any good person would remotely want to believe in hell. If you actually stop and think about it, it’s one of the most horrifying beliefs imaginable, that people who are different from you deserve to experience infinite pain for infinite time just because they’re different in belief. I guess this is a problem with many/all religions though that cuts really deep. But like despite that, religion holds tremendous value for me— Jesus’s example is a shining beacon of love and kindness to me, and having a religion and Someone to personally pray to can be just really comforting when I’m scared or sad.

I think a lot of my discomfort also comes from the fact that the very-Christian community I grew up in is just never going to understand me for who I am. Everyone in my community goes to a tiny local college, it’s kinda a big deal when someone goes to the best state school in my state. It’s absolutely unheard of for someone from my town to go to an Ivy League. And whenever I try to talk to people from my town, with only a few exceptions, they treat me as some genius god being, or as weird and different, or as socially inept or shy to the point of actively cloistering within myself (I am neuro-atypical). So I don’t feel super welcomed as a person, and I can’t help but wonder how people would treat me differently were I LGBT or Black. Even at Princeton the Christian community I’ve been a part of (PCF) isn’t welcoming to LGBT people, let alone back home (however I must say both these communities are very egalitarian when it comes to race, my hometown is typical white Southern Christian, but actually the church I grew up in is relatively diverse, race-wise and in other ways). Another thing that infuriates me to no end is that it’s assumed that somehow being a Christian is equivalent to being a good or nice person.

So yeah, I just wanted to talk about my discomfort with a lot of the trappings of traditional American Christianity. All that said, my personal faith is still important to me, and I find great encouragement and motivation to practice love and be kind in it. But I’m just really unsure about finding or fitting into a Christian community, since so many of the conventions and norms of such communities make me feel icky. And like, I’ve been taught my whole life that the church is a community first and foremost and that if you don’t love the church and its people then you’re not really a Christian. But what I really want to do is just disappear into the desert and become a wandering, alone-but-not-lonely monk dude who has a ton of really weird beliefs about God but consistently makes others feel valued, loved, and happy, because that’s the purpose of what he believes. I don’t literally mean “become a wandering monk,” but in terms of what I believe, that’s what I feel like, if this makes any sense. That’s all, thanks for reading if you got this far!",36804,

- It says there are 1,343 results for Year:2021, but there are three duplicates for some reason, looks like a changed email. There are 1,340 students and therefore 1,339 to eliminate!! 
- I have organized by last name. I couldn't figure out which names were multiple word last names and which were middle names, so I strictly used only the very last name, unless hyphenated, so blame tigerbook if it's wrong, not me
- please give me ideas on how to eliminate! for now I will be doing a random number generator but perhaps I could do fun ones like delete one for each letter of the alphabet, delete every 100th name, etc

i had managed to push these feelings aside and stop thinking about them after months of self-doubt, but i recently got contacted for an interview for what would be a dream job for me. i just finished the interview and i honestly don't think i'm going to get it.

it's difficult because i had accepted that the other position was the best i was going to be able to do for this summer, and had put it out of mind to stop constantly feeling like i wasn't good enough to make it in the field i've chosen. but now this interview happened and i'm reminded of what i dreamt of and what i thought i would be someday be capable of. comparing that to what i've actually been able to attain feels like such a loss.

i just constantly am left struggling with these feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. i feel like i'm disappointing my younger self, and failing my own expectations every minute of every day. 

don't know if it's the field i've chosen, or if it's just me. but there was a time i used to think i could do anything, that if i worked hard enough, i could accomplish big things and forge tangible change in the world. 

more and more though, i feel like that narrative was just a fantasy, and that in reality, i'm some mediocre kid who got lucky enough to get into princeton and be surrounded by amazing, brilliant peers, and i myself will stay mediocre the rest of my life, never being able to accomplish the things i dreamt of.

Well, when it came to it, they denied almost every request and only approved it upon appeal. Many of us made other plans in the time it took for them to approve appeals, and many of us can’t fully trust these exceptions after the distress of being told “no find your own way not to be homeless in a pandemic in a foreign country even though we said a week ago that we’d help, and now your planning time is cut in half”. Their exceptions tend to sort of help in the end, but cause distress and expense along the way, and don’t work out for everyone. It’s scary, and outrage is an emotional response to an emotionally distressing situation. It’s good to point out that there’s a plan that will prob help because it might help people feel less scared and uncertain, but don’t say that the outrage isn’t valid. We’re allowed to feel.",36936,

4/23/2021 5:52:07,"NOTE TO TYGA: 
Hi Tyga, this is a really long one. It's just my stream-of-consciousness ranting but I feel like it's too long to put in a normal post. For the sake of the impatient people, maybe it could be made into a doc that's just linked in the post? 

TEXT OF THE ACTUAL CONFESSION: 
i started walking around first college just before 3am wondering if i could chance upon an armed robber waiting in the shadows for a victim to present themself. i tried to imagine what kind of voice might demand i hand over my most valuable belongings, what kind of eyes might stare at me from over a mask and the barrel of a gun in these unprecedented times for hiding from the rest of the world. when i wear a mask no one can see my ugly cry face. i wondered if, upon being told “do it,” a would-be robber might falter with their weapon and try to explain to their victim that they just wanted their stuff and not their life per se. 

i want to withdraw from the semester. my life and the amount of work i let pile up are out of control. somewhere along the line i forgot what it means to live for myself. it is so hard to care about learning when i constantly just feel like i’m waiting for something. waiting for the next time i can feel properly alive again. i drift through all hours of the days like there are no stakes to fight for. i’m not lonely often, not as much as last semester. but i don’t recognize myself anymore. 

i headed up campus, past frist and towards mccosh hall. there are always so many lights on around campus in buildings that just make me ask why. here is the hall where i took exams last year, still lit up at 3am in the middle of a pandemic as if people are expected soon or already flooding its corridors. was our beautiful campus just like this, so bright and empty, that whole time we were banished? 

i only think about contacting my mom when i’m really at my lowest points, with no one else to turn to. it’s not quite the relationship we have for me to share uncomfortable things like feelings but some human instinct in me still draws me towards my parents. 

i walked past the chapel and into the courtyard of east pyne. in the archway, i had to physically stop for a second and lean against something to bolster myself against the ache in my heart from listening to such sad, sad songs. chinese is such a beautiful language. this might sound kinda fucking stupid but this song is about a fish, from the point of view of a fish. it is also just called “fish.” one lyric goes, “i am but a fish wallowing in the depths of this deep ocean.” it’s a very beautiful song and usually quite a relatable mood. i wish i were better at chinese so i could understand the lyrics i listen to, but i always know my translations are always probably somewhat incorrect if not completely wrong. 

anyway, this fish is in love with a fisherman, and just wants to reach them to be together. the fish sings that it will “break free from the bottom of the ocean” and swim with all its might upwards towards the water’s surface, “until i lose the energy to even swish my tail.” this implies the fish is one of those ugly bottom-feeders because those are the only ones stuck at the bottom of the ocean. 

i have excuses for everything. somewhere along the line i forgot what it means to live for myself. i never had any plan in my life except to write a goddamn book or three. getting into princeton was as much a surprise to me as everyone else in my life. that was genuinely the first time i felt like my parents were proud of me. that was genuinely the first time i gave my parents a reason to be proud of me. that wonderful time, high school senioritis, was the first time the parents in our community realized that my wonderful little sister was, in fact, the second child in our family. people started talking like they had always known i would amount to something, congratulating me. i felt like a paper doll cut out of the scratch paper my parents doodled on to figure out how to raise a kid, then raised to the light so everyone could see through me. 

i wanted to feel desirable, not disposable. i can’t believe i started crying before he even put his dick inside me. he had the wrong idea i guess. i like it when my skin twinges tenderly and the impact of words aches sweetly in my heart. i want to feel like i’m special to someone unconditionally. i want to forget everything and surrender myself to one moment and just pretend.

“maybe i should sink into inebriation or pretend to be insane / borrow your embrace to leave a kiss” 

i don’t want to go home. isn’t this what i’ve been waiting for? last year i said just wait for the fall. in the fall, i waited until i could be back on campus. now i eagerly anticipate the end of the semester so i can move out and live independently for the summer. i am reminded of who i am when i go home. my poor mother uses every phone call she can snag with me as an exercise in saying “i love you.” literally. it’s a little uncomfortable. last year i barely talked to anyone at home and it was fine. this year she won’t leave me alone because i woke her up with how loud i was crying under my sheets at home last fall. when she sat down on the bed and tried to get me to talk, i could not for how uncontrolled my breathing was. i let her pat me for a few minutes before i got it fucking under control and told her to go back to bed. 

“could my life be moved by a single unexpected, interrupting yearning? / in a mirage, after a moment of confusion, we recognized each other” 

it’s been so goddamn cold for the past two days. wearing long ripped jeans in late april feels the same to my skin as early february when we all just got back. the first time i went on a walk like this was a day or two after the first snow on campus. the snow covering poe field then would have killed someone with trypophobia. by the time i walked over it, it was all frozen over. there was no give on the surface, so i just went around fitting my shoes into the holes melted by whatever crowd was stampeding across the field. i imagined people jumping around while the snow was falling so that their footprints froze shapes into the snow cover afterwards. i liked that it was like a memory that lingered physically for a while. 

i no longer believe i can get along with my dad. i want to be strangers. i learned belligerence from growing up with him and always having to stand up for myself or my sister or my mother. i was the one who stood and fought with him and learned how not to cry. i took each one of his words and pressed them carefully into my mind, stockpiling grudges. we are too similar. the last time we spoke, it wasn’t even a real fight. just a typical parent-child disagreement with voices slowly rising until he tried to just walk away with a few last sentences and i filled in the rest of the tirade from memory, breathing out of control and shaking and just tired of fighting. no more energy to batter my tail against the fierce current, trying to make my way. 

i tried talking to a therapist for the first time this semester. we had a few meetings and she was always nice and respectful but i think i was a bad patient. i hated being the one to direct the conversation, but then we would just have long talks about things that weren’t the problem and i was wasting money for no reason. i was prone to shutting down, using hostile words, and being late, so i stopped seeing her. most of all, i hated when she gave me suggestions for how to change my behavior and mindset. i know i am struggling here but can i not try to be proud of who i’ve become. i’d like to think i went through a lot to become who i am today and i will not reject that person just because it’s unhealthy. 

dear professors, i don’t want to do my work. please don’t fail me. would that work on them? i think i loved learning once and looked through the course catalog for courses that delighted in how challenging they seemed. i can no longer wrap my head around the idea though. im waiting to feel okay again, do you mind waiting with me? we can see this to the end together. 

once, i had an ego and dared to be proud of myself for being a strong person. i would have these conversations with my poor friends where they didn’t know what to do and i didn’t either. they would walk me through their feelings and i would just be like, “haven’t we had this conversation so many times before? what’s changed? can you do something different, just break out of this cycle?” doing assignments should be the simplest thing ever, right, given deadlines and instructions to follow. but if you don’t sit down to do it, it will never get done. “duh,” i would probably say like punctuation. now it’s me and i can’t. i can’t quite wrap my head around the gravity of the consequences if i just choose not to do anything. the weeks melt by so quickly. 

“this is all that i have that is beautiful / if you like it, i might as well give it all to you.” 

i only saw my dad cry once. it was just over a year ago, i said out loud my suspicions that he must be somewhere on the spectrum pretty matter-of-factly, only a little bit of spite in my voice. when he looked at me next, i was surprised that he would even meet my eyes. the corners of his eyes were moist and glistening a little when he asked me if i really thought that. i’m just saying it would explain a lot of his behaviors. can someone or some science please explain to me his behaviors. 

the whole month before my move-in date that i had to be at home after the last “fight,” we moved smoothly around and past each other, avoiding. my mom acted like everything was just fine. i even thought she seemed cheerier than usual, which annoyed me. but she was probably just trying to make the mood better. still annoyed me. in the family group chat, it is very quotidienne and calm. lots of pictures of food and photoshoots from outings passed among the three of them. i don’t like the person i’ve become. i am so disappointed. maybe they are better off without me, the main source of internal family conflict, without a doubt. i learned spite and poisonous words but no control over them. i fear i’ve become the villain in my own story to tell, so i try to stay away. 

“only when you saw me lose my soul and fall / did your heart feel moved?” 

on my last lap around campus, i switched up the route a little bit and walked towards the bright light by the side of cannon green. two psafe cars were parked in the street like they were 69ing and as i walked by one car, the officer in the driver seat lifted a hand to wave at me. i waved back. the robber wouldn’t be so stupid to come back now, right? the campus is alert and waiting for them to show. 

i started writing this as soon as i got back to my dorm but i have so much else to do. somewhere along the line i forgot what it means to live for oneself. to anyone who made it through all of this to the end, much appreciated. if you can’t relate to all this right now, know that you truly deserve whatever degree of happiness/contentment you’ve attained and so much more. to those who do relate even a little, feeling that being alive right now is like a punishment for something, let’s all wish and hope at late hours like these that each others’ life sentences will be lenient.",36998,

4/23/2021 13:41:09,"If you have some time, please read this all the way through. I'd really appreciate it.

Hey, you. Yeah, you, the person reading this right now. ""But how do you know who will be reading this?"" Well, I don't. But I'm addressing everyone right now. ""You"" are everyone I've ever met and interacted with, and even some that I haven't. Okay, the grammar in that sentence sounds strange, but I digress.
I'm sorry. I like to tell you I enjoy helping people, but I've really strayed off that path. Honestly, I've been facing some mental health crises and other issues, and I've been dumping them on you. That's not fair. You shouldn't be bearing my burdens for me. I still want to help people. I want to do it right this time. I think back to the days when I helped un-bunk your bed and we probably almost got crushed in the process, or when I delivered fruits to you and got delicious muffins in return, or when I made you stuffies, or gave you feedback on your amazing content creation. I've fallen a long way. What have I done for you recently? I've lashed out at you over inconsequential things, ignored you for weeks out of pettiness, and generally have worn you out and pushed you away. I'm sorry.
Today, I want to redouble my efforts to make things right again. I want to turn over a new leaf. I always tell you that I want to help people, but I don't show it enough. A good friend of mine once told me that when I feel like I can't make myself happy, I should try and make other people happy instead. I've tried to follow that advice, but am generally not good at it. Let's change that.
For the remainder of the semester, I want to make it my goal to do at least one extra nice thing for somebody else per day. This could be a lot of things. I can buy you boba or something similar and bring it to you, or we can both go over (if you're on campus). I can try to help with homework or exam studying if you need (though I'm basically limited to intro-level PHY/MAT/COS type stuff). If you're stressed out over anything, I can try and be a listener, and maybe attempt to give some advice. I can probably do some other things as well. This might be a really long shot, but I had an idea. If you'd be willing to let me do a nice thing for you, please leave a Heart react. I can't promise anything, but I will do my best to do one per day. I'll pick somebody and ask them privately what I should do. Seriously, no strings attached. Feel free to back out if I message you, too. I only ask that you be willing to possibly have a stranger (or maybe somebody you know) spontaneously message you and do something for you, and that you do this in good faith. I'll even try to post daily updates on here to show that I'm really doing this.
Thanks for listening. Can you help me by letting me help you?",37008,

i'm just really struggling. i feel so burnt out and constantly exhausted. my head hurts from the minute i wake up till i go to bed. i have so many submissions and presentations in the next week, and i just really do not feel prepared and don't know if i can get through it. i feel sad and tired and angry and upset and lonely.

i don't know if/how to ask for extensions because -- thankfully -- it's not like i have any personal emergency to speak of and so many of the assignments are group projects. plus it's all dean's date assignments.

i've been trying my best to keep it together all semester, but over the last few days, i don't know if i can anymore. don't know what to do. ",37058,

4/24/2021 23:36:52,"To all the sophomores that get/ have woken up to shitty news, I'd recommend giving this a read. It's a pretty sad perspective, but hopefully you can do your best to understand it and then make sure you avoid following my path.
I've got a lot of friends who are sophomores, and while I think they're all dope people and should not have issues getting into whatever clubs they please, I've learned the hard way that bicker may just pick off one or two and leave them searching for answers. I know they'll ask me how I dealt with it (but I'm still praying none end up in this situation in the first place and can just go enjoy initiations and what not), which has forced me to reflect and in writing this try to organize my thoughts.
First semester sophomore year was probably one of best extended periods of time in my life (save some carefree summers). I made a ton of amazing friendships, solidified many more, found a community that truly fit me - something I never found as a freshman, and ultimately felt I had finally hit my stride here at Princeton. I spent tons of time just hanging out with my friends. I often would just causally work with others, half focused on work while simultaneously talking about random shit, many times not getting anything done (some people here would probably get frustrated by this, but I always left feeling content). I went out often - not in like an alcoholic or social climby way - but simply because I enjoyed having fun and spending time with my friends. My roommates and I would stay up until near sunrise having the stupidest debates. 
I'm not sure how good of a job I did in painting the picture, but all that is to say that I was extremely happy for that period of time. (Ima try to stay somewhat vague because even though none of this needs to be top secret, I don't need a bunch of randos knowing my personal shit).
Following intercession, it was time for bicker. I went into it humble, open-minded, and I think the right combo of excited and nervous. I wasn't and am still not a super outgoing person and am trash at forced conversation (I'll talk to Uber drivers nonstop from here to wherever, but put me face to face with another student and I'll usually come up with next to nothing), however I felt like bicker went great. I thought I had met a ton of awesome people at both clubs, was genuinely laughing through convos and games and stuff, and got the whole """"so and so really liked you blah blah blah"""" spiel from my upperclassman friends in those clubs multiple times. On all accounts, it seemed to have gone well. I was optimistic it would work out for me and all my friends, and we'd all grow closer while meeting a ton more cool people at the same time. Then I woke up that Friday and found out it didn't.
In a bunch of group chats, I had friends buzzing off about the clubs they'd gotten into. I got some sympathy texts and a couple friends even drunkenly stumbled into my room after initiations to try and be consoling. I'm grateful they cared, but at the time I had such a huge knot in my stomach and couldn't think about anything except for the future. It's been a year now, and all my worst fears of what was to come were realized.
Second semester was tough. Just about all my close friends got into their ideal eating clubs, even those who didn't care much for the scene in the first place. People began getting closer to their clubs' sophomore classes and my main couple friend groups began dividing and becoming more distant. I knew some cool kids who it also didn't work out for but couldn't convince any to sign in with me, and I had no interest in doing it alone. I had lots of great friends and had no desire to venture into a new community by myself and try to meet people from scratch. Had the friends I made through my first three semesters all wanted to sign in/ were already in sign ins, I definitely would have joined. Same with co-ops. But that wasn't the case. Meeting people in a club where you already have 15+ friends is wayyyy different than in club where you legit know no one. The latter would have just stressed me out.

I had a great summer, but this shit still loomed large. Curious coworkers asked me all the time what the party/social scene at Princeton was like. I hated this question. It's either you take the time to explain what eating clubs are, get asked which one you are in, then explain that you weren't accepted into one. Or you just deflect/ make shit up/ say something random. I usually went with the second option, but it was always such a pain to have this downer of a bicker result a constant reminder in my life. 

I came back to school praying my luck would turn. I shot my shot at fall bicker, but got swatted. To make things worse, just about all my friends that had also been hosed in the spring either got into a club in the fall or just didn't come back to school this year. This past semester was inarguably the worst extended period of time of my life. Crazy how different two fall semesters can be just cuz of one outcome. I now eat almost all my meals alone. As a matter of fact, I haven't shared a meal with anyone since intersession. Eating alone gets old real fast just btw. 
Almost all of my friendships have deteriorated. It's not the fault of me or my friends, just a sad byproduct of the logistical loneliness eating clubs create for the few handfuls of people in my position. I hit people up to eat with me decently often, but rarely get a yes. I don't blame them. It's hard to ask someone who is spending thousands of dollars for eating club food to spend more money to eat out with you. I go to my classes, but other than that I mostly just waste away in my room. I don't know what else to do. Frist is no longer full of friends of mine, if I walk through late meal, I don't recognize a single face, and there really are no common spaces near where I live. I want nothing more than to be able to go to a club between a 9am and 11am class to eat breakfast, or between an 11am and a 130 to eat lunch and hang out with old/new friends and just casually pass the time. 
Homecoming sucked. I tailgated and went to the game, but afterwards all my now graduated friends (and current friends) went to their respective clubs to chill after. Meanwhile, I walked down Prospect back to my room where I just sat, thinking about how when I come back all my friends will split into their clubs and I'll be left once again. Only this time I won't have a room to go to. Are nonmembers allowed in the clubs during the day of homecoming? I wouldn't know because I'm out of the loop on all things eating club related and am not the type to constantly be asking. 
I had high hopes I'd meet a ton of friends and cool people in an eating club through friends - again, I suck and hate having to do this type of thing solo. Instead, I have not made a single friend in my grade on campus outside of the classroom since before bicker. When or where would I? I don't want to join ec clubs just to join them because I feel lonely. I haven't lucked out and randomly met a new friend or SO by chance. Even if I did, that wouldn't solve my issues (but I still hope I do). 
I don't enjoy eating club parties as much now either. For me, it's just a mix of seeing close friends I barely ever see and wanting to catch up but failing, and seeing my friends with their newfound eating club friends/girlfriends/boyfriends. Parties are a bad place to catch up, but when people spend their limited free time in a club you aren't a member of and you never see them, sometimes that's just all you really want to do. I ask friends to chill, but people are busy and I get that. A planned hang out/ meal is different than just hanging around/eating in a club at your convenience. When you text someone to hang out, it's expected you'll do something together. I wish I didn't have to feel like I needed a reason to hang out with friends. I want to be able to just show up somewhere, see who's around, and chill for as long as I want. Same as a meal - when you invite someone to eat with you, you gotta have a conversation the whole time and all that. Seems normal, and it is, but sometimes I wish I could just be surrounded by friends/ acquaintances, enjoy a meal, and listen/chirp in from time to time rather than having to hold a full-blown conversation. Plus, when you share no experiences with someone - which is the case in many of my friendships these days as I rarely see anyone, you have less to talk about and even begin to grow apart. 
I'll stay in bed way longer than I need to because my dreams are often way more interesting than what I have planned for the day, and I'm now sadly pretty good at hitting snooze and continuing my dreams in 9 minute intervals.
This year has pretty much been hell. Taking time off would only make the three more semesters I need to complete even worse. I think my largest regret will be not going abroad this semester, and to any sophomores still reading this - especially those of you who got hosed, I strongly recommend you do it. Around the time the applications were due, I was still hopeful things would get better. I felt like going abroad would be like giving up on being happy here and just setting me up for a shitty senior year. I was an idiot. Things on campus have only gotten sadder, and I regret not leaving so much because I just feel so alone here. I pray senior fall bicker will be a thing next fall. I'm willing to suck up my pride again and give it another shot. Anything for another chance to get out of the place I'm in right now. But I doubt it will happen as I think my destiny is to just be sad here.
You may think I'm overexaggerating, but I swear not a single day has gone by in the past year that I haven't thought about how I'm not in an eating club. Something always reminds me one way or another.
I left out plenty more sadboi details as I'm not tryna put myself on blast. Even if people realized who's writing this, I don't mind much I'm not really averse to sharing. I'm just in the minority who got fucked and that's that. I actually hold no ill will against bicker. If I had to build a college's social scene from scratch, it would look nothing like Princeton's, but still. The fact that I know of so few people in the same spot as me means that the system works for a lot of people. If 95% of a friend group get into their eating club of choice, then Princeton's system is getting an A lol. I'm like the point you miss for rounding incorrectly or forgetting to staple you essay. 
I get this story has been pretty sad. I hope it has a happy ending, but I do not even know what that would look like. In reading this, I hope any sophomores in my spot realize real quickly how shitty things will get in the future if you don't take serious action and strongly consider abroad/ getting a bunch of friends to join a sign in/ co-op if you do not want to do it alone.

I'm not sure how this post will be received, maybe it gets shit on, maybe it garners empathy (which I legit don't care about, I'm just trying to analyze my situation so I can be articulate if asked/ felt I might as well share as I know for the few people who end up in the spot of being the only friend to get hosed these next few weeks will feel really lonely), and maybe it just gets buried like a lot of them. However, I imagine a lot of sad sophomores will be scrolling tomorrow looking for answers, and while I unfortunately don't have any great ones, I think knowing someone has gone through this could help (all my upperclassmen friends were successful in bicker, and while I appreciated them reaching out, they just couldn't grasp how I was truly feeling). I'd say I am a pretty atypical Princeton student however, so hopefully you end up going down a different path over your next 5 semesters and have lots of fun.

I'd like to end this sob story by saying I'm still the GOAT and I know it. Although I wish I was going to be having more fun, I'll still power through this place. I imagine this will spontaneously chafe me for the remainder of my life in one way or another, but hopefully will fade as I grow above it. Even MJ, Lebron, and Tom Brady have suffered setbacks, so I should be alright too.",37110,

4/25/2021 16:18:43,"Hi all– just dropping some opinions on the Princeton Tory that I've developed after reading a dozen or so of their articles.

Looking at the Tory website, I'm alarmed by the lack of basic journalistic standards. There are no news editors listed on the masthead, yet articles are often listed as ""news"" — who is overseeing these pieces? The current editor-in-chief just authored a news article, which seems odd, and many writers contribute both news and opinion stories. I am concerned that by blurring the distinctions between fact and opinion, this publication runs the risk of mislabeling opinionated content as news. It also tends to solicit student comments from members of its own organization. Maybe this is because conservatives are a minority at Princeton, but even so, there are plenty of potential voices to choose from. Finally, I've seen a lot of basic copyediting errors in print, as well as factual errors — for instance, they claimed the following in a news piece:

""Meanwhile, the political scene on campus has also become increasingly polarized, with Whig-Clio recently voting to revoke the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service (JMA) from Senator Ted Cruz ’92 (R-Texas). Whig-Clio later reversed course and did not revoke the award.""

This is misleading. Student members of Whig-Clio voted to revoke the award, a non-binding decision that was then brought to the board of trustees. The trustees voted not to revoke it. This process is misrepresented in the Tory piece, which makes it sound like the organization itself flip-flopped.

Anyway, I'm just surprised that the Tory wouldn't work harder to make itself a legitimate publication. I would be curious to know if the Tory staff members receive any training, whether on the difference between news and opinion, journalistic standards, and how to write fact-based articles without a slant.",37139,

** 2021 ELIMINATIONS ROUND 9 ** ANOTHER BIG ROUND
Last big round!!
Lol at the beginning of this round I realized I accidentally counted myself twice. So I deleted one of me and so there are actually only 999 left! And no it’s not cheating because I gave myself double the chance to get eliminated and the universe still didn’t pick me. I think I’m going to win. I was planning on deleting one last batch of 100, then lowering the number but since there are 999 it would physically hurt me to do any number but 99 so here are 99 eliminations

Commenting anonymously bc tmi but. This is super reasonable OP but ALSO you totally can do it! I actually got a menstrual cup partly because I hoped it would make me more comfortable with my body because I wanted to try to have sex but was scared. And it did help. Whether or not you try a menstrual cup I'd recommend taking a mirror and just looking down there. Literally with your hands just like...pull things open a bit, see what it's looking like, if you feel comfortable just stick a finger or two in and see how that feels. Doesn't need to be sexual, just to see what's there. If you do try a menstrual cup, the only real difference from a tampon is you might need to feel up on there a bit more to take it out (i honestly found tampons harder than the cup because my flow was pretty minimal so tampons usually stayed too dry). Tl;dr The cup does force you to be intimate with your body, but it's a pretty low-stress way to do it! And once you get the hang it's way more comfortable and you feel badass",37227,

I just kind of want to find someone well off and really busy with their own life that I could be in a mutually beneficial agreement where they'd support me financially to some extent (I'm financially very insecure and a supplement to whatever salary I would get upon leaving school would help a lot) and I'd provide some other forms of support that don't involve feelings.

I've tried sending her messages on Whatsapp (which I know she uses) but she never replies more than one or two words. So I've been a really bad grandkid and just called her for the first time in a really long time. Like, more than a year. It was so bad and the connection was horrible so she thought I didn't understand what she was saying because of the language but the funny thing is had I been able to hear all her words I probably would have. It was so awkward and she said a few times that it's been a long time since we've talked. I guess guilt tripping exists in all cultures but also I know it's bad. And I felt limited in what I could say because she wouldn't really understand a lot of the things I would say because her English isn't great.

It's incredibly hurtful to the already largely discouraged people who are putting time and effort to try to do anything, something, to be kind and caring to one another in the face of total and utter administrative indifference. Again, the reality is that many of these things you see on campus are done 100% by students, the university *does not even care enough* to officially get involved. The barrage of negativity and hostility is unwarranted and is making things worse for the students involved who are doing this out of their own time and care for others. I know many people don't know this about these things on campus, so I can't 100% blame you, but like come on, I'm tired of seeing so many confessions, tweets, and now a princetonian op ed with all this vitriol and hatred directed towards these students, and I know for a fact it has really, *really* started to affect some of them.

So, my partner and I have wildly different sex drives (think on the order of several times a day != once a week). I always sort of thought we would settle at a happy medium (maybe once every 2-3 days?) However, I find myself having sex almost every day, even if I'm just...not opposed to it instead of actively excited about it, and feeling guilty on days when I have too much work/am too stressed/too tired to have sex.

 They say they are 100% fine with just masturbating on the off days and tell me I shouldn't feel guilty about turning down sex, but when they masturbate it still makes me feel like I'm a failure as a partner/not fulfilling their sexual needs, and if we can't have sex for work related reasons it feels very isolating (like they're choosing to get off instead of spend time doing normal activities with me, a little). I also really don't want them to feel undesirable- I find them attractive and have had really awesome sex with them, I just am not in the mood for it as often as they are. 
 
Still, I recognize that it would be silly to ask them to stop jerking off so often , especially if I'm not trying to say yes to sex more often (we currently do it about once a day, sometimes every other day if I have a good reason to turn them down, but sometimes just the expectation that we'll prioritize having sex every day is stressful even if I do turn it down.) I'd love to hear from other partners with low sex drives of how to cope with feeling guilty about not having sex as often as your partner would like? Or whether I'm being too particular and should just have sex more often even if I'm not really into it? I can usually get into it once I start, but I still feel guilty afterwards for not doing something more productive/fulfilling with my time and I think if it were purely my choice we would have sex for a longer period of time more infrequently ( but then they'd have to masturbate in between, which, again, makes me feel like a shitty partner.)

i do not know who felt targeted by the image i commented that i left on the ""eradicate conservatives"" post, but quickly, i wanted to say two things. first, for those unaware, this image is cropped from a broader twitter exchange (https://www.thepoke.co.uk/2019/12/19/katie-hopkins-tweet-pointed-out-perfect/) which i thought was reminiscent of that confession. i believed people to be generally familiar with, given both its previous prominence online and by the reactions i received on it. this was not meant to be a threat of violence in any capacity. but second, i do acknowledge that my choice to crop and post what i did from it is rather ominous from the perspective of someone who was unfamiliar with that particular image, and i will not invalidate any fear that was aroused from it. 

instead, i will simply state that i am sorry. no one should have to live in fear of violence, and for anyone who might have been afraid from this post, and my attempt at humor, an easy reference, may have exacerbated that fear in a real way, and for that i apologize. it was lacking forethought about how it might have negatively impacted people, and especially considering the hellish times that we live in, this was careless of me.

i am not speaking on behalf of anyone else who may have commented, they may feel similarly or differently. it would also be cool if this post is not used as a site of discourse on the general topic, as fun as that might be for some, if only because it will be unproductive. be well, and take care of yourself and your community.

Why am I in chemistry classes that have four midterms? Why am in classes that have week 13s? Why do I have psets due this week? When classes are over? Before deans date?

Tell me why my ""chill"" class assigned us a final exam, a deans date paper, a final creative project, a research participation assignment, a final group project, weekly short assignments, all due within a few weeks? That prof, Casey Lew-Williams, spends lectures talking about how hard it is for students and children during the pandemic to do school work and talks about how much he cares about our well-being. But what does he do? Ignore his own teachings and assign us all these tasks. Yet because he wears funky ties and stands on chairs and shows us videos of his children he's a great teacher. He is nothing but performative.

I singled out Dev Psych because of how the class and the teacher present itself as caring, but are actually just as horrible as my STEM classes that at least don't sugarcoat and lie to me about how hard and uncaring they would be.

Most of the comments seem to come from a place of thinking “really?? that’s all we’re getting at this university??” And not in the sense of what students do isn’t enough but in the sense of that the university has failed to take concrete action, leaving some the MHI things as the most visible signs of mental health support at the university. I guess I’m hoping you can see that most people I know don’t want to come across as disparaging of your efforts but want to take the university to task for doing so little that it puts MHI and the students involved in a position where they have to be doing work the university should already be doing. And lastly, you’re right in that I didn’t know how little support the university gives MHI and similar efforts, so please know that I’m now even more appreciative of what you do, and I’ll be taking administrators to task for not giving you more support.

4/30/2021 21:40:12,"interactions with idiot visitors, a thread. i will start with 2 incidents, commenters please add more.
1) I am walking around Rocky, from the Holder Quad towards the Campbell/Joline Quad. I'm about to go through the archway that connects these two quads but then some asshole (who isn't wearing a mask, by the way) sorta asks sorta demands I go the long way around because his fiancé's doing a photoshoot. SMFH the entitlement. Dude, this is a school, people walk around. If you don't want to have passersby who, unlike you, live and work here in your photos, maybe you should have chosen a different place for your engagement photoshoot. For the record I did end up walking around because it really wasn't that big a deal, but in retrospect I wish I had told this guy off, I hope someone else did. Unfortunately I didn't see him again when walking back, or else I would have. Also, most people who do photoshoots here (I get it, campus is pretty as fuck) are perfectly nice and say don't worry about it if I'm walking where they're taking pictures, and in return I try to accommodate them by walking around if it's easy. But don't demand that I do so, and definitely don't come to campus without masks, yikes.
2) I am in my dorm chilling, sorta working sorta surfing the web, with the windows open since it's a pretty day. And some rando, also not wearing a mask (hmmm common thread...), walks up to my window and yells at me, ""are these the dorms? are they big/nice?"" COME THE FUCK ON LADY CAN'T YOU SEE I'M AT MY COMPUTER AND PROBABLY BUSY!?!!!? Yes of course this is a dorm!!1!!! What else would it be!!!! I ended up just ignoring her and she went away but eesh I just felt so awkward and icky. I despise being disturbed by noises from people outside my dorm wanting to talk to me (including even people I know banging on my window), my dorm is my own space where I wish to be left alone. I understand that visitors want to talk to college students about their experience, and if I were out and about and a random visitor came up to me and asked ""Hi I'm applying next year can I ask u about school"" I am never not happy to do that. But yelling at me while I'm inside my dorm? FUCK OFF.
Also I am aware I sound like a huge bitch in this post but most of the time I don't mind trying to help townies/tourists who are not being invasive, annoying, or entitled, multiple times I've helped with directions and sometimes even talk to visitors on my own initiative (if they're 1) wearing a mask and 2) have a cute dog I wish to pet.) These were just 2 interactions that really rubbed me the wrong way and left me feeling kinda awkward for the whole rest of that day.",37424,

4/30/2021 22:13:11,"With the recent influx in posts related to diet, exercise, and body image as well as the changes that come with warmer weather, we here at Princeton Body Positivity thought it'd be helpful to remind everyone that eating disorders are mental illnesses, not vanity projects, and provide some thoughts to consider when discussing these topics. Please keep in mind that this list is a starting point but not an all-encompassing rulebook!

Things to avoid saying to people with eating concerns:
- “You don’t look like you have an eating disorder!” Eating disorders don’t have a “look.” They happen to people of all body types and sizes.
- “Just focus on exercising and eating healthy--maybe you could go keto instead of starving yourself.” People with eating disorders don’t need diet advice.
- “But you’re beautiful!” EDs are illnesses, not vanity projects.
“- I knew someone else with [insert disorder] and he only weighed X pounds/ate X calories per day.” This can lead people to compare themselves and think that their illness isn’t serious enough to seek treatment.
- “You look so much healthier now that you’ve gained weight.” It sounds counterintuitive, but this can actually push people to start restricting again. There’s just no need to mention body size at all--to people with EDs or to anybody.
- “X told me you barely ate at dinner the other night.” Would you gossip about someone’s physical health condition? Think about whether you’re showing concern or sharing personal details unnecessarily.
- “I wish I had your self control” or “You eat so healthy!” This essentially tells someone that their eating disorder is admirable, and it trivializes all of the struggles that lie behind what looks like “healthy eating” or “self control.” Besides, aren’t there more interesting things to comment on than someone’s food choices?
- “I ate too much,” “I need to exercise more,” etc. Commenting about your own eating and exercising habits can be extremely triggering to people with EDs, even those in or working toward recovery.

For an additional list of misconceptions about eating disorders, as well as alternative phrases that avoid triggering or trivializing the experiences of people with eating concerns, see here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1phvIKwc7CX8YRJrgfo0apsfW-RQgKuBH34y_2mYnAbo/edit?usp=sharing",37426,

5/1/2021 11:25:31,"Thank you to body positive princeton for their post!!! While it’s really important to know that you can’t diagnose an ED based on looks, here are some non weight symptoms to watch out for. (These should never be used to decide that someone DOESNT have an ED, but if you notice them, please note it.)

Rapidly thinning hair— restricting— within 4-6 weeks of restricting, your hair starts to get brittle and fall out. This is so common that there’s discussion of testing hair strands to diagnose anorexia. It’s most obvious in weight girls with fine hair because they have less volume to begin with, but if you notice a big change in the way your friends hair looks, note it. Brittle nails go along with this. 

Small scars on the knuckles of second finger—purging— this happens when someone’s knuckles knock against their teeth over and over again. It’s called Russels sign if you need a visual. 

Fine downy hairs where ear means jaw/all over— restricting— this is the body trying to keep you warm. It’s called lanugo if you need a visual. 

Swollen back part of cheeks— purging — this happens because stomach acid causes inflammation in some of the glands at the back of your face. 

Hidden food wrappers— bingeing— people sometimes feel a lot of shame around eating. Hidden wrappers can be a sign of eating in private. 

Difficulty eating around other people— all EDs— goes with the shame above. 

Cooking elaborate meals for other people: people who restrict calories heavily often become obsessed w food. (Google Minnesota Hunger Experiment.) Sometimes they feed other people elaborate meals to almost eat vicariously.

Dry skin—restricting/purging— people with anorexia and bulimia are often obsessed with food. 

People in the comments should feel free to add others, so we can be a more aware and safe campus.",37450,

(possibly a hot take): but you know what i absolutely hate? why the hell does faculty need to be forced by admin before they take any steps to accommodate students' mental health in any way? they can write email after email about these ""unprecedented times,"" but refuse to actually do anything concrete to account for this. 

out of the fourteen classes i've taken over the last 3 semesters, only one of my classes (props to SML 201 and Prof Guerzhoy) cared enough to actually get rid of a major assignment in accounting for how difficult things have been for students.

i refuse to believe that all profs are just unaware of how difficult things are for students. why can't they do anything to account for students' mental health and what they're going through? why must their hand be forced be admin every time? why do most of them need reminders about ""how difficult things are for students"", and to take it easy?",37486,

The situation is quite dire there. So many places, including Delhi, Mumbai, and other regions, have immensely severe oxygen shortages, because of which COVID patients suffocate to death before they can even be treated. It's sad because oxygen isn't a rare or complicated resource, and a (relatively cheap, as far as medical equipment goes) appliance like an oxygen concentrator can help so much. I'm glad that the EU, the US, and others will be coming through, but it's so heartbreaking to watch, especially when a loved one is affected.

Everyone is looking out for themselves, including grad students who rely on reluctant undergraduates for their data. Sure, there's no perfect sampling method because they'd all yield some bias of sorts (a monetary award would most attract people who need the money, for instance), but if the Prof can't recognize this and assign less other work so that the studies aren't as much of a burden, then it's kinda insensitive and shortsighted to blame undergrads for looking out for themselves and prioritizing time where it'll most help their grades.

From feeling pathetic after receiving failing grade after failing grade on so many exams that are sure to affect my overall grade in multiple of my courses, to getting a burst of energy and working hours prepping for a group project only to realize that I was useless when working with them. In between, I called my mom and talked to friends who said they believed in me, but here I am, knowing full well that I could possibly have to retake a course or two once this semester is over. Of course I feel like a failure. I know I am not supposed to compare but knowing how others are pushing so hard and are worrying about getting B's, I can't help but feel so isolated when I've reached this low in my academic performance. While it's not ideal, I know that the vast majority of students here will sacrifice mental health in order to get that better grade, so I feel pretty dumb for not choosing the same path. The sad part is, I've been trying to fight off some pretty awful thoughts anyways and I haven't even put in the effort to give a viable reason for why. Maybe I should stay up later to study, maybe I should not give myself that break because do I really deserve it? I try, sure, but I don't try enough, you know? AHH and it feels like such a cop out to go to my DSL and be like ""I feel sad"" and expect anything.

the headspace man
(y’know, the one with 
the australian accent)
told me yesterday that
in order to invite 
acceptance
into my life,
i first need to 
notice moments of
resistance and
acknowledge them. 

resistance is
an impromptu boy scout meeting
taking place in my stomach—
twisting my nerves into sailors knots,
yanking them back until they’re taut slingshots,
catapulting bad thoughts around 
like bouncy balls 
striking the walls of a gushy squash court, 
already too close to collapse. 
overpriced popcorn bursting and breaking,
until i think i might be sick. 

“what is it that you are resisting?”

he emphasizes the usage of 2nd person pronouns. 
i forgot why.

i let the question sit.
it sits 
and sits
and sits until
it sinks down into my belly,
rapping relentlessly on the door
of the rec center—
“meeting’s over, boys.”

it’s just words,
but the words 
quell the panicked thoughts—
the scarier words—
just long enough for me to
grab my rope back
and hastily fasten 
my own knot 
to them.
the words become my anchor
against a current more powerful than
anything 
aquamarine’s relentless father 
could have conjured. 
they don’t ask for an answer.
they just keep me afloat
for a while.

resistance is 
my brain
spiraling into swirls of tri-color rotini—
a divine, iridescent rainbow of overthinking:
am i actually just a psycho bitch?
is this even about you, or is it just about me?
am i making yosemite-scale mountains
out of molehills,
and whacking myself to pieces 
as the me-moles 
poke their heads from 
their holes,
like a self-destructive,
hyperfixating bitch?

in salted, boiling water, 
these thoughts
swelter and
fester until
al dente, 
breath calming them down.

i was looking through
photos
from this year
the other day and
i could barely find any
where i was 
smiling—

when was the last time 

~you~

were truly, unequivocally
happy?

As someone who spent some time drafting the petition, its just so rewarding to see it actually come to fruition.  I hope that the policy is made department-wide, but even if its not, I just want to say thank you to all the CEE-ers out there and all the other non-CEE folks in department courses who signed it.  I'm also amazed to see other STEM departments using the petition to get optional exams.  It's been such a rough semester, and there were so many times that I felt isolated, and missing a sense of community, and these acts of unity across departments have really given me some hope.

What: Mini Sit-in/just space for mental health support & community since so many of us are struggling so badly 

Where:  Right in front of Nassau Hall

—— 

Due to SO many people reaching out to apologize for not seeing this on time to be able to make it on Tuesday, I’ll be doing a REPRISE TODAY (TH 4/6) 😊 

The weather won’t be Quite as nice [in the mid 50s-60s most of the day, but sunny/mostly sunny with no rain] but getting sun is still good and so is company 💙

I’ll head over (actually) around 10:30 and will definitely be there until 2 (i unfortunately have meetings 2:30-4) and might come back after 4 if people are still there/interested. 

I unfortunately don’t have the bandwidth to bring all the things I brought the other day- but if anyone has little crafts, snacks, feel good notes, etc that they’d like to bring that would be awesome ☺️

Otherwise, please just come to sit & do work & show anyone walking by (and potentially anyone (ehem, Admin) inside NH how many students care.

See y’all soon ❤

Okay so we've talked about the Super Secret Orgy Club and proposed hug/cuddle club, but can we also get something in the middle? [genuinely not a joke] Like can we get some kinda SHARE-peer-esq system that [does extensive background & character checks and vetting of all who want to participate] is available to help survivors be able to start being sexually active again? Like someone who is literally educated and trained in helping to navigate the road to being intimate again & all the ugly, visceral flashbacks and panic attacks that come with it (before, during, or after)? Because I honestly know so many survivors who could benefit immensely from something like that

This might sound trivial to those who don't have the same history/experience, but my friend is a senior and has jokingly yelled about how she wants to ""FINALLY BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON MY HOE PHASE NOW THAT I'M NOT SUPER RELIGOUS; I'M IN MY PRIIIIMEE!!!"" and it's hilarious and frankly fits with how horny this entire campus seems to be judging with these TCs... but it breaks my heart because we both know it's not that simple and probably never will be.   Having been violated by strangers and intimate partners alike, being able to be vulnerable in Any way with Any one is something a brained rewired by PTSD just Won't let you do...  Like wanting to get fucked by someone other than the Princeton admin after this piece of shit semester is Mentally, Emotionally, And Biologically valid as hell. But when fulfil your wants and needs becomes synonymous with exposing yourself to a potentially extremely triggering circumstance, well, yeah, that's  -generally- Not one of the goals of last-week-of-college ""hoe-phase"" hookups.

c) I can't help but feel like part of the mental block comes from being raised religious and even though I think it is So. Fucking. Stupid. and absolutely against All of the teachings from the Bible to Not love someone solely because of who they Love... I still can't help but wonder if there's still this indoctrinated part of me that like shuns the idea of myself being anything but cis-het?  My oldest friend form the 1st grade came out a year or two ago and it sickened me that she had felt the need to repress and deny herself for so long because of what we were taught growing up... my older sibling came out as trans at 32 years old and I could not be any happier for them <3   I just can't tell if this is me still holding onto some super harped & indoctrined ideas or if it's jus the classic (and very me) move of extending waaayyyy more grace compassion and support to my friends and loved ones than I can for myself? 


d) I also feel like as someone who grew up always in the privileged majority- white in a hella white, Catholic, republican farm town who attended a 92% white school & even though we definitely didn't live like most people in our bougie ass little town, I still never struggled financially with the necessities and grew up in a largely happy and healthy supportive family home....   those things just make me feel like I've been far too privileged to now claim to be part of a historically egregiously marginalized and oppressed group of humans, especially when I'm not even 100% sure I ~am~ bi???

5/10/2021 1:54:12,"Just woke up from a very confusing and disturbing dream (and I’m gonna write about it instead of finishing my DD assignments): 
For some reason, I have been invited to a meeting of the board of trustees, I assume as some sort of vehicle for student input. Anyway, it’s like 10 people, including Eisgruber, Jeff Bezos, and for some reason, my mother (who has no ties to Princeton other than through me), all seated around a long table.

I have some LEGO pieces in my pocket for some reason, and am surreptitiously trying to put them together without the board members noticing, but my mother sees and starts nudging me in her way to try to get me to stop. Anyway, eventually Eisgruber calls on me and asks my opinion, but of course I have no idea what we are talking about because I have been building the LEGO thing and not paying attention.

To cover for my lack of focus, I nod my head in assent and tell Grubes I totally agree with what everyone else has been said. Then he says in his special voice, “It’s settled then, now that the undergraduates approve. All classes will be virtual in the fall.” I have inadvertently approved a terrible initiative. 

Jeff Bezos smirks at me from across the table in his evil way, as the other trustees clap. It is then that I come to the belated realization that I have been bamboozled. I am now the Jar Jar Binks of Princeton, Eisgruber is Palpatine/The Senate, and Bezos is Mas Amedda. My distraction with the LEGO bricks (no doubt delivered by wily Amazon drone) has led me to betray that which I hold most dear, the prospect of a normal fall semester.

Anyway, that was the dream. Hopefully it’s not prophetic - Eisgruber hasn’t invited me to any clandestine meetings yet, and I haven’t found any cool LEGO stuff in my pocket. Maybe they were just probing my mind. Or maybe I just want to be dominated by Bezos and Grubes and this is how my brain expressed that to me?

5/10/2021 20:47:06,"Reply to 37980. I was in an extremely similar situation a long time ago, a former very close friend just gradually stopped wanting to see me when we were in the same place, and just started taking weeks or months to reply to texts until they stopped replying completely. I remember worrying about and spending mental and emotional capacity on wondering if I had done something to hurt them, or why they wouldn't want to talk to or be friends with me, and it was just really unhealthy and draining. Eventually I came to similar feelings it sounds like you have. Right now my take on the situation is that I still care about them a lot and want them to kick ass in life, but I am content and happy and healthy with our lives being disjoint. And probably want them to stay disjoint for the foreseeable future. So yeah. I just wanted to say that the last part of your post, where you said you wish them the best but not want them in your life, is a really healthy and empowering realization!

Also, the students will often not be considerate of your time at all, and will text you the day-of saying they need to meet to do an assignment due the next day.

I came here in January praying that this would be a 180 from my homophobic family and finally find my community after ten months of feeling completely isolated from all my high school friends. I really thought this was finally my turn to have something good in my life- to start off college well. Instead, I've spent virtually every weekend alone. Cried through every deadline, finals, dean's date.  It's hard to leave because I feel like I've accomplished nothing over these four months. I don't think I've started college yet. I haven't made any meaningful friends. I'm not quite sure what I've learned in my classes. I've been rejected by so many different clubs and publications it seems like my artistic voice is completely invalidated. I leave this semester feeling even emptier than when I came here.

but my sister is my best friend. it's been getting harder and harder to keep this from her, to avoid asking if he was ever weird with her. i just want to know. she cut him out of her life when she was 14 as well, and maybe it's just a weird coincidence, but it really haunts me. i just cannot bear the thought of my mom finding out; it would absolutely destroy her, and tbh i think she might be mad at me if she does. SHARE was useless, and while my friends have been extremely supportive and always willing to listen, i wish i could talk to someone who actually knew my dad, who knew how cruel but also loving he could be. this is such a hard place to be in. how do people do it. pls send me love. being at home is hard.

5/13/2021 19:31:12,"Genuinely one of my greatest (and probably most naive) hopes for the future of this school is that the pandemic has put a stop in the momentum of bicker eating clubs. The racism, classism, and general snobbishness that the eating club system promotes is unhealthy and beyond undated in 20 fucking 21. Eating clubs are a shining beacon of institutionalized racism and classism, and yeah, so is Princeton itself, but let's start by breaking down these stupid big houses that take up so much of our time here. 

I'm a graduating senior but please, underclassmen, please don't put as much stock into this system as so many classes before you have. It's all bullshit. And now that I'm so close to graduating, I'm almost embarrassed at how much time and energy I've wasted thinking of them. This school will be so much better off without them. 

I feel like I've seen slow change over my own time at Princeton on how much stock people around me put into clubs, and the return back to campus seems like the perfect opportunity to keep the stopped momentum of eating clubs' impact on social life the way it is. All eating clubs do is further stratify an an already stratified campus, and I genuinely cannot think of one good thing that would be lost if all eating clubs just became sign-in tomorrow. 

If nothing else, please do something about it so that when I have to explain eating clubs to my incredulous and slightly horrified non-Princeton friends, I can at least say, ""Yeah, but that was before."" The social dynamics they create is not normal. Do better than everyone else even though we couldn't. ",38163,

5/14/2021 18:43:03,"Coming to Princeton is really an opportunity to broaden your world view and better understand your own convictions and privileges by meeting and engaging with people from different backgrounds. Nonetheless, some people, particularly students who come from rich families, always cluster among themselves and are never willing to engage with, talk, and meet anyone who is not wealthy like them. It is sad, but it is true. Merely posting stuff on social media to show that you care about people whom you would absolutely not engage with in real life is pointless--and what is more scary is that some don't even advocate on social media either. It makes me sad to think about how these people will go out into the world never really having known or interacted with someone of a different background one-on-one out of their own volition. I want these students to know that maybe if you just take a chance on people who are different than you (people who are not white and/or rich) and have a meal or grab some coffee with them and really try to get to know them, then perhaps you will want to be friends with us too--or at the very least want to get another cup of joe with us.",38212,

I feel like I’m having the polar opposite experience of everyone else because all semester I was feeling either emotionally baseline or even happy, wasn’t even ever really drowning in work like everyone else, but my mood absolutely plummeted as soon as I came home. I absolutely cannot stand being around my parents. I hate where I live. It’s not that I feel disconnected from my pton friends, I’m not the most social person so I’m pretty much as connected to them now as I was before, and I don’t really have that many friends from hs (not like in a bad way, I’m not lonely or anything in that regard), I just… hate it here. Geographically. I even hate my fucking house. Like physically. The physical house I’ve lived in my whole life. Absolutely everything about being home just makes me want to go back to school. It feels like it’s a choice between being at school and constantly having deadlines and assignments and classes or being at home and being academically free but constantly miserable. It feels like every other day since I’ve been home I’m annoyed and worked-up enough to want to throw a temper tantrum like a five-year-old. I really hope it gets better before next semester because it hasn’t even been a week and it already feels like I’m at my limit. I feel like there’s really not even that much to be upset about, that I’m definitely just overreacting and need to talk to a therapist to feel better, but then I also feel like I can’t do that because (a) an uncomfortable conversation with my parents and (b) we’ve just switched insurance to a worse plan, so I don’t even know if therapy would be a financially feasible thing to ask my parents to pay for. I’m just miserable and I hate it here and I want to leave and be on my own and be an adult and live where I want and be able to find things that I enjoy. And I can’t even talk to my parents about it because I barely speak to my dad and my mom would be a mess if I even ALLUDED to the fact that I hate it here. And it feels so stupid when everyone else is having a way worse time than me and I’m just over here pouting like a child because I don’t like being home.

France actually is by the best estimates 50% Christian but again at Sciences Po there are probably less than 10% of the student body who call themselves Christian (you can easily google more precise info for these stats if you want). Oh and btw I'm not sure we can say that Presbyterianism is one of the most ""liberal"" or ""progressive"" strands of Christianity either theologically or socially. Anyone familiar with the history behind Scotland's Solemn League and Convenant will likely have a thing or two to say about Presbyterian theological attitudes towards tolerance of the views of other Christian sects. And in social terms, I mean you only need to look at South Korea or the Indian states of Mizoram and Nagaland to see the role of Presbyterianism more generally in driving fundamentalist purist social teachings regarding LGBTQ+ rights and womens rights etc. ",38295,

5/20/2021 15:32:06,"Compared to a lot of people at Princeton, I'm not particularly competent and I'm definitely nowhere near as intellectually curious, socially savvy, or ambitious. I lack both breadth and depth of understanding when it comes to a lot of real-world topics, have social anxiety to the point that it affects my life in pretty meaningful ways (e.g. I haven't gotten a haircut in over half a year because I don't want to interact with the barber; I generally avoid talking to friends unless they initiate conversation first, which is entirely an error on my part but I worry that they see it as a sign that I don't want to talk to them; I avoid forming strong opinions or entering conflicts even if it means failing to stand up for something or someone important to me, etc.) and don't really have anything I'm passionate about. I'm not talented at anything that I consider meaningful, and while I have uncommon interests that people find amusing, they don't really outweigh the fact that I have difficulty making conversation or connecting to others even when they make it a point to reach out to me. I feel like I'm always either too unassuming and incompetent to be taken seriously by others, or rigid and dispassionate to the point that people think that I'm TOO serious. It's like I'm a supporting character in my own life. Some people around me are really good at things I wish I could do or have skills I wish I could have. Others are just good at being positive people who are happy with life in general, which are probably the type of people I envy the most. In comparison, I feel like I have nothing. My academics are really good, but that's mainly a product of my own insecurities pushing me to unhealthy extremes and not a reflection of my own drive or abilities. I'm prime evidence of the idea that you can be in the top academic percentiles and still be a gd moron. Grades and awards shouldn't determine your inherent worth, so it's pretty embarrassing that they're more or less the noteworthy thing I have to show for myself.

Normally, people who think like me are told they'd benefit a lot from a change of perspective. A lot of the time, they're told to look at the bigger picture and realize that they do hold value and they do have things that make them special, and to realize that being in an environment like Princeton naturally gives rise to impostor syndrome.  I entirely understand that outlook, but it's never really made me feel any better. My difficulty in interacting with people throughout my entire life has kind of led me to become a hateful and envious person, and there's not a single minute where I'm not comparing myself to others. I don't want to be complacent with realizing that I've reached my natural limit. I'm too selfish and petulant to be happy with my life knowing that I am, and always will be, overshadowed by others who have accomplished greater things and become better people--kinder, more interesting, more personable, more driven--than myself. I've used this inferiority complex as my main source of motivation throughout life. Anything and everything productive I do is born out of the idea that I'm building towards a day where people will have to be forced to see me as a competent person with legitimate accomplishments. The problem is that I've begun to realize that I will probably never reach this day. I have one more year of Princeton, and then I graduate, and then what?? Nothing will change. I'll definitely harbor these same feelings for years to come since I plan on attending school even after undergrad, and I'll probably feel the same way in my professional career. As long as I have this outlook, I will never be happy with myself, but the moment I lose it I will have nothing driving me forward and nothing that I care about.",38396,

(the walls are really really thin) yes, so i stayed in bed, literally staring at the ceiling or falling back asleep. before i head out, i think ""what would they feel being alone?"" and then i feel so bad about leaving them alone so i stay home (or delay my departure). when i am doing work, i can't focus bc there is another person in the room with me. when i want to work out, i don't feel comfortable working out bc (once again) there is another person here. when i want to cook, i dont want to bc i dont want them to watch me cooking. i really made a mistake rooming with another person. it isn't their fault either. i just dont feel comfortable with another person in my space. and some things they do just dont make me feel happy either, like i would always do both of our dishes but they would only do their own, they always always always (!!!) have their partner over (our place is really small) and i dont like that, they always play their music/tiktok out loud and i cant focus with noise, etc.. (i know i can talk to them, but i have anxiety issues and bringing this up or even talking about me feeling uncomfortable to them is not an option for me) majority of these are just things that i should've considered before deciding to room (yes, my own fault for not thinking really far) and there is no where else i can go either. i havent been working out, waking up at times i want to, doing things i want to, or preparing for my internship bc i literally just cannot cannot cannot (!!!ahhhhh!!) focus! my whole schedule is thrown off. i am having so much anxieties bc my schedule is off, and my anxieties cause me to be even more off of my schedule, and this is an endless loop. i really made a mistake. i feel so sad. i wish i can go back in time and rent by myself. i don't know how i can do this for another 2 months. its barely been a week and i am already suffering. i don't know what i am looking for here, any advise would be good. i think i would be going to the library pretty often (but it is quite far and the hours are very short). there are no cafes nearby that i can do work in. i have no where else to go. im so sad. so sad.

5/20/2021 22:03:20,"A lot of people are getting their grades back and feel really bad about it. I want to let you know that with some perseverance, it is possible to bring it back. 

Maybe I am the best example of this. At the beginning of my Princeton career I didn't take the school's academics seriously. Before being honor coded in my first semester, I felt that Princeton academics hadn't been too difficult. That was not the case. 

After my return, in my freshman fall semester I had a whoppingly low GPA of 1.925. I had two Cs, a D, and a B-. I was very, very close to being removed from Princeton in my first actual semester. In the spring I took three courses and ended up with a cumulative GPA of 2.057. 

In my second year, I took more classes and tried much, much harder at them. I think it's hard to really convey how difficult six classes is. Nevertheless, I finished my second year fairly well and ended up with a cumulative GPA of 2.5. 

Despite that hellish experience, I did it again because I had found it bearable. I separated myself from all my distractions -- mainly video games, but also heavily limited the amount of time I hung out with friends -- and tried to be a better human being in general. I have now taken 28 courses at Princeton and for the first time have crested the 3.0 GPA mark that I set for myself after my second year. I have successfully -- and quite luckily -- found a wonderful internship. Sure, I'm in the fifth quintile, but that doesn't matter to me. I now proudly stand with a GPA of 3.029 and look on my last three years as one of the best growth periods of my life. I have learned so, so much and have formed so many new friends. In many regards, I am proud of myself but am even more proud of my friends, who supported and encouraged me every step of the way. 

But I didn't want it to end this way. 

In this most recent semester, I missed three COVID tests. I missed two in one week because I didn't realize that we couldn't submit them on the assigned days (mine was Monday and Wendesday). I then missed another because I was distracted by independent work and applying for internships along with my Dean's Date work. 

Tomorrow I will be meeting with my DSL. I am worried -- if my previous suspension and a potential disciplinary probation ""add up"", then there is a serious possibility that I will be expelled from Princeton. I am hoping some of you could share your experiences with the process and what I can do. If I am expelled...for one thing, I'll be expelled. But it also means that all of my hard work over the past three years will be more or less entirely erased. And in this economy, my career prospects might as well be gone. 

Please help me. ",38405,

Some people act like Hamas & The PLO, and the IDF & The Israeli Government accurately represent the will of Palestinians/Arabs/Muslims (interestingly, they forget about Palestinian Christians and Jews) and Israelis/Jews respectively, which is simply not true. This also holds true for other movements against the actions of governments, like with the CCP and Chinese people in the past two years.

I don't know how many people here have seen this show, but the fact that Redo of a Healer is actually hyper-supported by a good portion of the anime community really makes me really despise it (the community, that is). It's not even a well-written story -- it's literally just revenge porn laced with content about sexual assault that is clearly written for a predatory male audience. The author of the original light novel himself admitted (in a recent interview) that ""If the avenger sexually assaults their target, that's fun to watch"", and the fact that a lot of twitter supported this view frankly disturbs the shit out of me. I knew that a good fraction of the weeb community was filled with degenerate, sexually repressed guys who fantasize about deplorable and illegal sexual acts, but having a work out there that publicly normalizes rape and sexual abuse is truly a new low.",38450,

i was wondering if any of the graduate students on this page had any advice about preparing for graduate school applications... I'm not really sure what I should be doing?? i'm doing summer research with a professor here, and i'm looking into summer research programs at other universities for next summer, but im not really sure what i should be prioritizing.

i hear gpa doesn't matter that much, and it seems like the gre might be starting to get phased out?? should i just go super hard into research at the expense of aiming for As? (i.e. stronger research but maybe B+/A- range grades vs A-/A range grades) I know ideally i should have good grades AND good research but.. i feel like i sometimes get caught up in classes here so much that any attempt at research during the semester falls flat... 

if i work primarily with a graduate student, how do i get the professor to write me strong letters of rec?? how many profs should i aim for?? is it better to have one professor i have a very strong relationship with having done multiple years of work together, or start migrating to other professors so I can have multiple letters?? i really dont know how to min/max this like i did with college apps lol.... i know thats prolly not the right way to think about this but right now i don't really have a gameplan",38456,

I ['24] had a few very small high school scholarships from the fall semester that I reported and sent to pton, but if I remember correctly they said that my financial aid was just reduced by however much money I got in scholarships??  I also reported a scholarship through my job that I was expecting to receive for the 2020 fall semester, but after the company denied my application, I called the financial aid office and they said that they would remove the reported scholarship and just replace it with Princeton grant money.

This doesn't make sense to me because then what's the point of applying for scholarships if they just replace money you already would've gotten (without having to do extra work)?  My dad wants me to apply for a pretty sizable scholarship through his employer but obviously I don't want to go through all this effort of listing all my high school and college achievements and writing an essay if any money they send me would just be money that Princeton would have already given me just for existing...

The spotted lanternfly is an invasive species that poses a threat to ecosystem and agriculture in the Philly area, including Princeton (I didn't see any when I was on campus but Pton is on the state of New York quarantine map)

The instructions given by the state of Pennsylvania are to step on them/kill them, but keep in mind that they jump A LOT. So you won't get it your first try - usually the second jump in a row is slower/doesn't go as far so it's easier to get it then.

Upon seeing a lanternfly, the state also says to report the sighting (links below), which is definitely a good idea in Pton since I don't think they're as widespread in the area.

1. What is an ideal resolution to the conflict? Would it be to remove all Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, return those who have lost their homes in this area to their rightful residences, and declare the union of these regions an independent Palestinian nation? Does it go further and involving ""returning"" previously conquered lands that are now firmly under Israeli administration (like the Golan Heights)? Or maybe all of Israel? And if so, what happens to the Jews who have settled there?

2. Does the land in contention ""belong"" to the Palestinians? If not completely, then what parts? And how do you justify this, especially since it seems like the ancestors of the current Palestinians employed methods of conquest and slaughter that replaced a majority Jewish/Samaritan population with an Arab Muslim (""Palestinian"") majority? Or is the question of who the land belongs to wholly irrelevant?

5/27/2021 12:11:25,"Not to sound too bitter or anything, but seeing Whig Clio get special privileges with ODUS while ODUS struggles to meet the needs of other clubs frustrates me. ODUS recently posted they are hiring a ""Whig Clio"" coordinator to work with them. I know Whig Clio is its own legal entity and stuff, but they already have so many resources and institutional memory, whereas it feels like, in both my own experience and in talking with other student group leaders, they often fail to meet expectations with smaller groups. As a former ODUS org officer for a group that has fall, winter, and sometimes spring events I can say that ODUS often times is very slow to respond, inconsistent with guidance and expectations of rules, and it feels like they don't have enough manpower sometimes to handle all student org requests, not through a lack of effort but just due to constraints of limited staff or sub-optimal allocation of university resources. I remember having to call ODUS 3 times just to try to talk to someone over the summer for a fall event but she was so busy she was always unavailable - even though the first two times I was told she'd be free when I called (she literally was just so busy with university stuff, not her fault).  I also know of a student club that did fundraising from alumni just last year only to be told that all fundraising has to be done during a certain portion of the calendar year and so they had to return every last cent of it, DESPITE the fact that previous years they had done so with ODUS knowing without issue (again, unclear enforcement/rules). On top of all this, ODUS also really doesn't have a great way to give feedback. From what I've been told, the senior survey has listings for ORL feedback and PACE center feedback, but I don't know if ODUS was even on there. Even if it was, I feel like they need to do a better job with that, because I know talking w other people that I am not alone with these sentiments, and waiting til senior year is really not a great way to deal with issues. ODUS folks work so hard and I have a lot of respect for them but it's so frustrating sometimes.",38590,

Three years ago when I first got to campus, I remember Tiger Confessions actually had some lively back and forth debate despite the majority of people being left leaning commentators. Now, however, it has turned into a full on echo chamber. At first I liked it because as someone with a super conservative hometown, it was refreshing seeing a majority of people share my views. But I feel that it has become detrimental for everyone recently. Some of you are so vitriolic and seem to drip with your own perceived sense of moral superiority that it has clearly kept people from publicly disagreeing. To the same predictable 20 people that comment on these echo chamber posts, no I’m not acting like conservatives are victims. But only a fool would think that this type of discourse is beneficial for anyone. This doesn’t mean racist, homophobic, and sexist ideas need to be tolerated, and it also doesn’t mean that we should be attacking everyone with a different opinion that centers around the role of government. If you weren’t aware, you can’t adequately argue for your own point if you don’t thoroughly understand the oppositions points, and many of you clearly do not understand the opposition. The left is its own biggest obstacle to winning support, and TC discourse is evidence of that.

If they get mad they take it out on me, and when they're happy they expect me to be happy with them too. If I get mad at them for screwing around with my feelings, they dig out my own insecurities and blame it on that instead of taking responsibility for hurting me because they can't control themselves. And the worst part is they're the ones more insecure about me than I am about myself, so it's like I have to feel bad about myself with them? They always joke about me being too dependent on them, but when I finally find my own independence they tighten all the reigns.

I've wanted their attention for way too long, and now I'm hurt because I've put all my hopes into such fickle, flippant people.

There were no popular packages implementing the analysis that we could find, presumably because it was so recently developed. But we had already submitted a proposal about it. So, crying and throwing up, I said I would implement it from scratch using the lab's original paper, which detailed the math, and that he could help by adapting parts of the paper descriptions into pseudocode. During one of our meetings while we did this, I remarked that it was so annoying that the authors obviously had code that accomplished what we were trying to do, but hadn't made it public. He agreed with me and then said. He said. He said that he was just realizing it . But that the lab had a GitHub that he found. Weeks and weeks ago because he had read the paper ages ago and researched the lab out of interest . And he asked me, ""do you think that might be helpful?""

I have a very close friend who suffers from depression and PTSD. She’s an amazing, caring, loving person who’s always been there for me. However, recently her symptoms have gotten a lot worse, and her family (who has been emotionally abusive her whole life) is not supporting her/recognizing the gravity. I’ve told her I love her, that I want her around forever, that she can call me anytime she needs me. I check in with her all the time. I try my best to be there for her as much as I can.

It doesn’t feel like enough. The other day she was acting weird through text and said “I love you” which she hardly ever does. I didn’t think much of it but she had actually overdosed on benzos and it was her way of saying goodbye. Thank god, she survived, but woke up 20 hours later. She told me later what happened and I couldn’t stop crying. That she could have died and I’d never have known what was happening. I’ve told her over and over that I think she needs more professional help, but she doesn’t listen to me and says she is scared. I don’t feel like it’s my place to go over her head and institutionalize her, and she’d probably never forgive me if I did.  But this is just so hard. Every time she doesn’t text for a while I think the worst. I’m stricken with guilt that I might be letting her down. 

Does anyone have any advice for how best to help her? Any warning signs to look for? How can I convince her to get more help? This is really bothering me and I just want to do the right thing for my friend. ",38619,

I use to be such a geek as a kid and read manga and watched anime but at the same time i hated my skin and tried so hard to forget what color it was. i have short stories and fanfics i wrote where every character, including the main one, is white or white skinned. when i got older i realize how fucked up that was and tried to look for media that wouldn't fuck me up like that and found, at the worst, normalized colorism and at the best, a minor character or two that had brown skin but was barely present on screen and who the fan community barely mentioned. I wish I had things i could geek out about where i could actually project myself onto the characters and think that they're just like me. The older i get the more hopeless i feel. Maybe when I'm old it'll finally be normal to have dark or even just tan skinned characters in stories but i just wish so desperately i could have had them as a teenager or at least now. i can't bring myself to show interest in my friends' interests because it always jumps out to me how easily they can identify with characters and make headcanons about them... But for me, the the immediate visual barrier of how light their skin is will stop that.",38676,

5/30/2021 21:38:36,"Hey Tyga, I hope you are having an amazing summer! 

I know you're new to running the page and everything, and that running a confessions page has work and stress that is invisible to us commenters. But I think it's kinda weird how you treated certain posts about Palestine. One OP asked you to consider banning or limiting posts about Palestine, and you said you might. After that you posted multiple submissions about Palestine (all about charity, none about ""discourse""), so it's unclear what posts are allowed. I assume, based on today's batch and a post I submitted which wasn't posted, that you are allowing posts about charity, calls for aid, and sharing the stories of people who died, but not allowing more ""discourse,"" which tends to become repetitive and vehement even if OP is genuine. I think that is a good policy. But you should make it clear what sorts of posts are allowed by making an announcement on the page, like the old Tyga did when they temporarily banned or limited certain topics.

Another thing I want to mention is that it wasn't cool to put a post asking for charity and a post about discourse in the same thread. I thought the discourse post you grouped then was made in good faith and probably should have been posted. But it doesn't belong with a request for charity, which should not be grouped, so as to increase exposure for a good cause. Giving to a charity for children in Gaza actually helps people. Talking about politics in academic terms doesn't, if we're honest (and ""spreading awareness"" does not count as help since anyone not living under a rock is aware, or intentionally ignorant at this point).

I know that running a confessions page is harder than it looks to me, and I don't want to dump on you while you try to figure out your own moderation style and how you want to shape the page. But ""don't group charity and discourse"" is something you should have done, and it would be nice if you could settle on and tell us a clear policy for posts about Palestine. Please continue to allow posts about charity for Palestinians. Their suffering is horrible, and they desperately need help. Please also continue to limit the sorts of discussions that lead to the rightists and leftists slugging it out in the comments. 

I wish you the best with running the page, and that you have a wonderful and restful summer! <3",38685,

I eventually became proud enough to put a (real) profile picture and sign my stuff with my actual signature. I still am proud of my drawings, but I'm NOT proud of the shit that I liked/favorited. A friend from high school recently went through my favorites on one site (for real, wtf?) and shamed me for one slightly sexual drawing of a ship. I was MORTIFIED to remember that I looked at some stuff like that when I was a kid, even though none of it was explicit, and I've now taken down all blogs I remember having.

6/2/2021 23:56:16,"*Please take this confession below at face value, i.e. it's NOT supposed to be commentary on or take away from other critical issues than what it directly describes.* 

I've refrained from putting Hebrew/Yiddish as language proficiencies on any official documentation not just in light of recent rise in anti Semitic/Jewish sentiment, but also because of underlying sentiments that I've been so often exposed to growing up. (For reference, people don't ""automatically assume I'm Jewish"" (whatever that means), and I live in a fairly liberal area, and still have experienced many direct and indirect instances of bigotry of varying degrees). 

So my question is, then: how can I take better, more honest action? Would it be strategic to put something like ""various Semitic languages and their derivatives"" until I'm more comfortable to specify? I know there should be something like ""if that company refuses to hire you because of a language/religious assumption/etc. then it's probably not a company you want to work for OP :)"" but it's incredibly unclear how implicit bias might limit employment opportunities (as it has shown to drastically do so for POC, for instance, but I have no data on what those stats would be for Jewish employment-seekers or for filing anything official).

6/3/2021 1:56:39,"As a fan of Glee, I imagine I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but I rolled my eyes SO hard at that Glee confession. I have no idea why SO many people stan a bully (yes, Santana was a bully, idgaf what y'all say, and Rachel may have been annoying to some at times, although I generally loved her, but she was the one being bullied and Glee Club was the only place where she DID get a chance to shine and even that wasn't cool in the rest of the school until the very end). 

Mr. Schue's behavior w.r.t. creepiness definitely warrants discussion, but Sue is not a hero that should be worshipped. She MOSTLY did awful things, and most, if not all, of her disses towards him had absolutely nothing to do with calling out bad behavior (lot just involved shitting on him and Glee for the sake of it and trying to funnel an outrageously unfair amount of resources for the Cheerios and, more jmportantly, herself). How she treated Becky is no excuse for the rest of her behavior, especially since she basically turned Becky into an awful and hateful person herself, imo. And as an Ohioan, i take issue with the idea that talent doesn't belong there 🙄 it's high school, and unfortunately there's not enough space and scholarships for all talented high school students to be funneled into fancy prep schools, so until then yes talent can be found anywhere, including - * gasp * - OHIO!

It's something that has been going on for a while but that I am just noticing as a problem (and am still not a hundred percent sure if I am just overthinking this). My mom and I (cis-female for context) are very close forever. I am an only child, and she is a stay-at-home mom who is very much involved in every aspect of my life. I share most things with here (even the guys I am dating, drinking, etc.). She is pretty open, and I never really feel uncomfortable sharing things. But at the same time it often feels like I have to tell her things. Like it's an obligation. A lot of the time she touches me in inappropriate places or makes crude jokes about my breasts. This has especially been happening a lot since I have gotten home and haven't been home for the entire semester. She says it's a joke and just kidding around. When I bring it up as a problem she gets mad and gaslights me, saying that I am overreacting or saying that I am changing after going to college. In a lot of cases, when I ask for space, she makes me feel bad about it. (As I am typing this right now, she is making loud noises in the kitchen to show that she's angry at me and has been giving me the silent treatment for a couple of hours after she touched my breasts and I pushed her away and yelled at her). She says I don't care about her anymore and that because I am not living at home, I am changing and am not the same. She says I take her for granted and doesn't understand all the work she puts in to make my life what it is now. I often don't know how to react in these situations. I usually end up apologizing. But I don't even know why I do that. I feel like it's even hard for me to think about this right now, and I try to ignore these problems. It took me a lot of time to convince her to stop checking my phone messages and social media accounts, and she always holds it over me when I try to talk to her about something that is bothering me. I just don't know how to make it stop because it's actually bothering me but I don't want to hurt my mom.

Is it just like, het people intruding in gay spaces for their own sexual enjoyment without regard for gay people’s comfort and safety? Cause that is CREEPY AS FUCK. But I didn’t really think the post was about that, if anything I thought it was likely made by a thirsty gay guy (but OP’s orientation should be irrelevant to how creepy the post is).

The most recent of course comes from Ketchup. I am neither for or against ketchup, but the severe toxicity that TC expresses towards anyone who claims to have voted for ketchup, or shows anything but anger towards ketchup supporters is belittled and basically cast out, thus further strengthening the weird echo-chamber mentality that TC has going on. 

Overall, it seems that TC has an issue being able to see many issues, including ketchup ones, from other sides of an issue, therefore the only ones that are seen are the ones that are in tune with the overall mindset of the average TC member, and once again keeping the echo-chamber alive, unless someone is able to convince me otherwise.",38807,

your other friend was there 
in the background and i figured
maybe you just wanted to hang out with 
her instead
which is fine but i was just 
really looking forward to seeing 
you which made me suddenly 
feel really icy and aloof because
i hate the idea of wanting someone who 
doesn’t want me.

yesterday i took a nap and 
had a nightmare that
i was walking through an empty chancellor green 
and suddenly i was pole dancing
in the middle of the room and 
i was actually really good at it
(not to brag)
but then i tried to stop and i couldn’t—
my leg crooked around the silver rod
as i kept sexily spinning
trapped on this feverish merry-go-round 
until i was overwhelmed by the terror
of dying alone. 

i saw a fox yesterday in the forbes backyard
and it was pouring rain and 
he was wet and i was wet because
i didn’t bring an umbrella probably because of 
my protagonist syndrome
but i stayed really really still
which is something i’m pretty good at apparently
and then he kinda laid down a few feet away from me. 

i pondered, what if we… just stayed out here all night?
he looks at me
i look away
haha jk unless?

i broke my phone speaker because 
i felt the need to listen to the 
fearless re-record and cry
in the rain.

then i cried a little more
after i realized the impact that
the male gaze 
has had on my behavior.

have you ever seen a fox lie down
it’s really cute because they kinda curl up and fold
their paws over their tail

The Philodendron was lonely. It had been hanged by its owner upon the branches of the trees just within reach of their balcony. The sun was especially hot that day. A body which should have been flexible in the winds of early summer instead rattled and peeled at the whim of a breeze. It seemed to wonder, what could I have done to warrant such treatment? There is no answer. 
Originally implied, it must have been that the once frequent waterer took a great deal of time caring for the plant. It’s decaying tendrils reached several feet in length. Once viridescent, it now cries for help, for the life it once had, yet refuses to accept any charity from those offering, loyal to its mother. 
	It will most likely spend the rest of its days hanging in the tree, subjected to swinging and rotting in the sun. Perhaps once the plastic handle weathers and breaks or if there is a new tenant, the Philodendron will be put to rest. For now, it continues to cry and wait until its corpse can be buried among the other lost and forgotten children.

Where do you get off thinking you’re so much better than other struggling people because you aced intro classes that you ALREADY learned and ALREADY have a solid background in? you had the access and resources to be able to get that background, and you had a significant advantage like??????  

If you’re one of these people, by all means take advantage of your prior knowledge and get good grades, but think twice before you tell someone that PDFing an intro math class that they may have zero knowledge in is “soooo embarrassing.” Think twice before you proclaim loudly about how easy X class is around someone who may be struggling to pass it because they come from a different background than you. Think twice before complaining about how “ashamed in yourself” you are about your B+ on an exam to someone who may be trying to cope with their D on an exam despite having put in their best effort. Think again before implying that people who get lower grades than you or struggle in a certain class are more stupid or lazier than you, when you obviously have a CLEAR advantage over many of these people and most people are truly doing their best!! Like how are you so blind and oblivious?? 

Some of yall need to stop tying so much of your self worth to grades, because you’ll automatically internally project this self worth onto others and see them as less than you for having lower grades than you, and it shows. yall needa work on yourselves, because your toxic elitist internalizations don’t just affect you negatively, but also the people around you.",38891,

Since I needed to see someone weekly I was referred to a therapist off campus (in downtown Princeton but now we are meeting virtually) and that has been going much better. There were 1-2 therapists in CPS I met with that I did really like but they are no longer there. :( It was hard for me to actually get the motivation to call and find a therapist but it is worth it. You might have to ""shop around"" a bit to find a therapist you like but it's totally fine to switch therapists at any point. If you're in the Princeton area and on the student health plan, many local therapists are in-network and completely free to see right now (normally it's $10 or $20 co-pay for in-network).",38933,

As someone who's been on the other end of this a few times, there's a couple things that could be going on

First and foremost, if this person has made clear to you they don't want to speak with you rn DO NOT try to reach out still. Give them their space and time as they have asked for, even if you don't know why they need it. 
If the above is not the case in your situation and this is someone you care about/want to keep talking to, there's a couple possibilities:
1. They are genuinely busy. In this case, reach out and be like hey what's up we haven't talked in a while, what's going on. They will likely reciprocate enthusiastically and be like sorry I've just been busy! Now you guys can keep talking while keeping in mind that this person won't be replying as quickly as usual because they are busy but nothing is wrong. You're good to go!
2. They are upset with you for some reason. Reach out the same way as above. You likely won't get an enthusiastic response and they will likely just say they've been busy but not seem enthusiastic or matching your energy. If that's the case, you might want to either ask whether you've done something to upset them (not ideal since they might not want to tell you) or make more of an effort on your part to reach out to this person consistently as that might be what they want you to do and they feel you don't do this enough. Over time if they seem to be more enthusiastic/energetic in your convos then things are getting better but if they keep not responding much or v dry texts only then you might want to ask what's up and give them some space.
3. They are going through something personal. If that's the case, they may or may not tell you what but depending on how close you two are, proceed accordingly (ie giving them space or conversely talking about it but in both cases make sure they know you're here for them)

It's a small thing, but I see it as a recognition that I deserve to be happy, and that I deserve to pursue my hobbies or fashion sense or whatever the case might be--not all of my actions/purchases have to be practical or about changing myself in some way to be ""better"" or stop hating myself.

The acting is more natural, lighting is good, effects are decent, guardians are convincing, Reynolds does embody Jordan’s personality and likeness well, and it has a dang good Sinestro.

To be fair the bar for quality DC live action movies is low, but as they go, Green Lantern is pretty decent. It just had a little too much focus on love life and not enough on plot. ",39004,

It never really made sense to me, and we all know that there are extremists in every religion... But now, as an adult actually properly educating myself on other religions for the first time, I've found out that Muslims literally believe that Christians are blessed as ""people of the book."" What the hell? It did not take much research to find this out. This is also completely contrary to what Christians believe, since we technically should proselytize everyone and ""go make disciples of all nations"" if we take the Bible at its word. Islam is inherently more tolerant of Christianity than the other way around. ",39011,

I thought coming home for the summer was the right choice with my internship being virtual, but I'm starting to think I made the wrong decision. At first I just kinda accepted it, that I wouldn't see my friends for most of the summer but it's started to effect me really badly. I've never been this lonely in my entire life, and I've been crying every couple of days about it. Just with the circumstances of this summer, none of my hometown friends are here, and all of my Princeton friends are thousands of miles away. I thought I could fix this by trying to reach out to people I hadn’t spoken to in years to try and reconnect, but I've been fairly unsuccessful. It's mostly been a lot of left on delivered or being blown off. I think I'm entering a really tough spot mental health wise and I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty about it to, because I home with a loving family who supports me but I still feel so sad and lonely. I've never struggled with my mental health before and I just don't know what to do. I also feel so much worse when I'm on Instagram or Snapchat seeing my friends have so much fun in New York, DC, Chicago... and think that could've been me if I wasn't so dumb.

6/13/2021 11:46:21,"My grandparents’ story is so amazing and cute and I wanna turn it into a movie so bad

My grandmother was 17, from a wealthy family, and was being pressured by her mother to marry this rich boy who was a family friend. She liked him okay, but didn’t love him. She and her mom got into a huge fight one day and she ran away with one of her friends to California (from Michigan). After spending some time there, her friend wanted to go home. So, they started heading back. Near home, they stopped at a carnival that traveled across the country. My grandma took her friend home and then stayed with them and began working selling lemonade.

My grandfather was 16, from a very poor family, with an abusive father and lots of siblings. He and two of his brothers left home looking for work. Soon they found the same carnival and got jobs setting up rides and games.

My grandfather’s brother (18) asked my grandmother if he could ride with her to the next location instead of with the crew on the bus. She said sure. Turned out he and my grandfather both really liked her. My grandfather was jealous and asked her as well. She said sure. My grandfather then proceeded to go brag to his brother about how she asked him to go with her. This made his brother upset or embarrassed or something, he decided to ride with the crew.

Apparently something magical happened on that car ride they took together because they’ve been in love ever since.

It feels wrong to be happy because im a toxic person and everyone around me gets hurt. But this upcoming semester is so crucial to me with school and application season and i just cant be depressed. Im thinking maybe i can just weather through it with anti depressants but i’ve never been on them and im still so afraid to go on them. I have a history with eating disorders and serious body dysmorphia so the potential side effect of weight gain is really terrifying. I know how pathetic i sound and why do i have so many problems.

The way you mentioned you are scared no one will kiss you because you are in a relationship, for example, makes it sound like you are worried not that they will be uncomfortable, but that it presents as an impediment to getting what you want. Maybe it's not that deep or just bait, and I don't want to sound preachy or anything here, but it just came across as you wanting to use romance to just make yourself feel better, possibly without really considering the feelings of others and how your actions might make others feel worse.",39092,

6/16/2021 14:45:32,"Ive been having an issue with something here for a long time, and Im hoping you all could hopefully give me some answers. So my friend (Asian) keeps calling me (mom Asian, dad white) the ""product of yellow fever"" and also keeps referring to my dad as ""captain yellow"" for the fact that he married my mom. My friend is generally a jokey kind of guy with others too but Im wondering whether I should be offended either for my own sake or for the sake of other mixed whites-Asians in general? Like it's easy to blame my friend for stereotyping my parents' relationship but the strange thing is what he's saying is kind of actually true. Before he met my mom, my dad seemed to exclusively date Asian women and Im hard pressed to find girls of any other race that my dad was with before my mom. My mom has kind of laughed it off as ""men are men, let them be"" and chooses to ignore his dating past but yeah tbh my dad has a questionable history in his dating choices. But what's troubling me is whether I should act defensive around my friend? Like he's not wrong, but is it insensitive on his part? I personally don't care but should I be telling my friend not to generalize about all mixed white-Asian relationships when he's only really talking about my dad and my mom?

ITALY HAVE SCORED A GOAL!!!1

No binch, say Italy *has* scored a goal. 

""Croatia are going to the finals!"" tf? Just say ""Croatia IS going."" The team is going. Nobody in the post game interviews is saying ""This team are so resilient, never give up, always fight to the end."" See how stupid that sounds? And I guess as a way to brand it as more authentic, US outlets like ESPN use this construction on social media too when talking about international soccer. It really just seems to be unique to soccer.

It makes sense in certain contexts, for instance when using the full team name. The Philadelphia Eagles are going to blow their draft picks on crappy wideouts. The Tampa Bay Lightning have repeated as Stanley Cup Champions. But you just say ""Philadelphia is going to blow..."" or ""Tampa Bay has repeated."" This is universal to every sport, except, for whatever reason, in the mind of the Bri'ish and their Commonwealth cronies when it comes to foo[/glottal stop]ball.

Go to the Manchester United wikipedia page. The first sentence uses ""is"" to describe them. The very next paragraph uses ""have"" instead of ""has."" No consistency, even within their own silly little game. What happens if you put it in other languages? You'll consistently find the singular case, not the plural.

There wasn't anything truly wrong with the relationship persay, except that I was always thinking about breaking up and doubting everything while in it. And I tell myself, I should feel sure about a relationship if it's a healthy one. Some days I feel fine and like I can finally move on, but then the following day I can't think about much else. We are not on speaking terms, and it just gnaws at me, but I don't know how to fix it. The relationship was LDR, which I think somewhat led to its decline, and we would still be LDR if we got back together for the foreseeable future. So that makes me think I should just stop obsessing over the past and stick with my decision but at the same time, why is it so fucking hard?? He was my best friend in the world, and it just hurts so much to think about where we are now, but at the same time I can't stop thinking about it. I miss him. It's always at the back of my mind, overshadowing everything. He doesn't want to be friends, and I'm so sad but I guess also understand where he's coming from because it'd probably be really painful? He hasn't been very nice to me since we broke up, sometimes even trying to manipulate me to get back together and honestly I want to so badly, but I don't know if that'd be the right decision because it feels like everything is different now after the breakup. I try to tell myself that he's not good for me (which for the record, I think is true on the whole), but my heart just refuses to process the message. I'm SO not over him, I don't want him to be with anyone else, I haven't met anyone else, and everything just hurts. I try to distract myself from wallowing in self-pity and longing for the relationship, but it's not a long-term solution because as soon as the distractions are gone, there's nothing left but the overwhelming feelings. I just want to be loved, I guess. I don't know what the point of this confession is, I just feel like I have a lot of pent-up feelings that I don't really have close enough friends to dump them on.

My mom is adamantly refusing to get vaccinated, and when my brother and I ask why, she always cites random family friends also refusing to get vaccinated (while conveniently ignoring the ones who did get their vaccine) as well as hemming and hawing about ""considering all risks and perspectives"". She recently tried to use the existence of vaccine incentives like lotteries to somehow prove that vaccine doubt is a valid position if there are enough people who believe in it to require such incentives. While my dad is planning to get vaccinated, he told us tonight that he isn't going to make any attempts to change my mom's mind and that if he didn't feel socially obligated to get vaccinated he wouldn't, which disappointed me more than I thought it would. 

I know such thoughts are irrational, but I can't help but feel personally responsible for low vaccine rates among conservatives and how it is impeding the nation's progress towards normalcy, which greatly distresses me. I used to be under the impression that misinformation and conspiracies were specifically targeted at the uneducated, but both my parents have graduate degrees and so do their friends who also believe in this hogwash. Fake news scares me to no end: all it requires is for its potential audience to subscribe to one facet of their ideology (in my parents' case, social conservatism) and it ropes them in to believe in everything else it offers hook, line, and sinker, even when it betrays their self-interest.

Response to #39099

I’m going to bring up something that seems to digress a bit from the main point but I urge anyone who wants to have an actually rigorous conversation on the to topic consider it. 

Why are we dismissing 50% of the actors in these wmaf relationships? Aka, asian women. What would we find if we looked at the dating history of asian women currently dating white men? I would wager that many of these women had almost as exclusively as their partners been in wmaf relationships. I mean its hard to know conclusively, but let’s say the data is something like; in wmaf relationship “captain yellows” dating history (romantic involvements) was comprised of 95% asian women and for “captain whites” it was 80% white men. It’s hard to say conclusively, obviously, but think about the wmaf relationships you know. 

To be honest, I don’t think there is anything intrinsically wrong with wmaf relationships if they are consenting relationships with mutual respect. Not every WM dating an AF is a colonialist predator, not every AF dating a WM is guided by internalized racism. Asian women do not belong to asian men, they are free to date whoever they want. Likewise, white men are also free to date whoever they want. It’s ridiculous to attack them as colonialist for ever dating outside of their race. Let’s not forget we live in a globalized poly-racial society where we value individualism and the right to choose one’s own romantic partners. 

Sure you might not like wmaf, and you wouldn’t want to be part of one, that’s great, no one is forcing you to (hopefully). But at the same time ask yourself if it is fair or productive to judge people in wmaf based on literal prejudices about asian fever or internalized racism. Lastly, I won’t deny that many wmaf relationships are not perfect/devoid of problematic complexes or power dynamics.

6/19/2021 8:03:15,"So there have been a lot of posts recently relating to ""yellow fever"" (#39099, #39153, #39148, #39119, #39121) and while some inputs I felt were polite and valid there were a lot of opinions that really, frankly, pissed me off. As a white male who is dating an asian female, it frustrates me to no end to think that there are people who will look at our relationship and think it's any less real or legitimate simply because I'm white and she's asian. I love her because she's HER, not just because she's asian.

Now story time. My current girlfriend is not my first girlfriend, and as a matter of fact I have only ever dated at least part-asian women in the past (granted the number is very small, but still). I hated the idea of having a racial preference because I thought it was ""racist"" and therefore sick and a terrible thing to do. I was accused of having ""yellow fever"" by my friends and family while dating my previous girlfriend and even though they didn't mean anything bad by it, I absolutely hated it. I hated it so much that I felt insecure about it, to the point where, after we broke up, I actively tried looking to date a non-asian girl--and indirectly pressured by my friends, family, and society, I thought this was a good and righteous thing to do.

Then, one day my freshman year at Princeton, still determined to date a non-asian girl to somehow absolve myself of racism (the irony pains me), I found myself stressed and struggling with something school related. Then, like an angel sent from the heavens, this beautiful girl came over to me just to chat, and ended up helping me out. The 'old me' would've gotten excited that such a pretty girl had initiated a conversation with me. But ""I have changed"", I thought to myself. ""I'm not going to engage in what seems to be like potentially flirting because... she's asian"". I was determined to stand my ground, as my internal morals fought viciously as I struggled to suppress any attraction to her.

Eventually I came to my senses and realized how absolutely bold-faced racist it was in the purest form for me to NOT let myself be attracted to this kind and charismatic girl simply because she was asian. And I gave in, and ended up completely falling for this girl. Now, nearly 4 years later we are dating, and I love her more than anything in the world.

My point in all this is not to defend myself, or try to convince anyone that I'm not like other white males dating asian females, but rather to show that the ""yellow fever"" stereotype that makes wmaf couples out to be illegitimate or a product of some sort of fetish or internalized racism is hurtful, and for what it's worth, very often more inaccurate than it is accurate, at least I believe. And not just hurtful on a personal level, but it sends what I believe is a damaging message to everyone.

I still don't think I do have a racial preference toward asian girls, but what if I did? Would it really be good for me to rule-out asian girls, and say, force myself to date a white girl, just to absolve myself of racism? I don't think so. I think focussing on race or any other factors involved in dating preferences is far less important than focussing on having meaningful, legitimate relationships, and I think if people are too concerned about acting on conscious, or even unconscious preferences that may be viewed poorly by society, they are less likely to find themselves in a meaningful, happy relationship.

I believe good people can have preferences--even racial preferences--and I think it's wrong for society to tell them that they must suppress those preferences. People can't control the type of people who they are attracted to. Some people like tall people, some like short, some like big some like small, some like quiet people, some like chatty, some like smart, some like funny. I also think there are certain traits that correlate along racial lines, and if you look at racial preferences as simply preferences for certain traits that happen to correlate with a certain race, does it really seem like such a bad thing then? A previous post (or maybe it was a comment on a post) mentioned that white men who date asian women are hurtful because they assume X, Y and Z about asian women. That's a fair point, and certainly can be worth getting upset about if you are an asian woman but not X/Y/Z, but what if all the women that man has dated were X/Y/Z? And the reason he dated them was because they were X/Y/Z and he liked that about them? Then it's not him making a racist assumption, but rather the opposite. He very well could have just been dating them because he liked the X/Y/Z traits in women, and happened to only find them in women that happened to be asian. Replace X, Y and Z with any traits that tend to be true among asian women (they have straight black hair, tend to be on the shorter side, etc.-- they don't have to be weirdly fetishizing or offensive) and that could very well be a perfectly normal, nice guy, who happens to have only dated asian women, as in the case of the OP of #39099's dad.

Finally, I'm not saying that having racial preferences/fetishes is never creepy or can't be creepy -- they certainly can be (and the word 'fetish' is inherently creepy anyways), but in those situations where it is creepy, I would bet there's more than likely more going on to make it creepy besides just a history of dating within a racial group. Based on the white guys I know who are in relationships with asian girls, all of them seem to be in happy, legitimate relationships, and I don't see anything wrong with that, even if one or both parties involved have a preference that matches their partner. I'm inclined to believe this is the case with the vast majority of white male - asian female relationships, and the whole 'wmaf relationships are illegitimate/gross/fetishizing/etc.' thing is far more often wrong than it is ever accurate. Alright that's about all I had to share. I hope this doesn't offend anyone, or gets taken the wrong way.",39170,

It feels terrible and brings me a lot of anxiety. I feel so guilty because I know it's so unfair to assume, but I can't help but remember that no one thought my father would hit my mother and this makes me unable to believe that a male would not do so because my father is so, so good at acting, it's fucking revolting. So far, there has only been 2 males in my entire lives who made me feel like they really would never hit their wives. This habit is making me feel sick and it is not helping with my nightmares at all.

6/19/2021 13:50:30,"Alright folks, buckle up... I have absolutely no plan going into this one.

I've never exactly been an *expert of social interaction*, so I'm having a hard time understanding what's normal and what's not here. Lately more than ever, my friends just literally don't respond to any contact I try to make with them. I'm not talking like the ""I'm especially busy rn, I'll get back to them tomorrow/next week/next month"".. I'm talking like they literally do not respond at all. Granted I don't have a huge sample size here, it's not a small number of friends that do this. 

Here are a few examples for you. I met a new friend a few weeks before the end of the semester. *I thought* we hit it off and had multiple late-night study seshes before move-out, were texting here and there, got food with other friends multiple times, etc. I sent them a text like right after move-out to see if they got home safely (and made sure to set it up so it was clear I was hoping for a response bc I've noticed in the past that if I just say like ""I hope you got home safely!"", then they're almost guaranteed to not respond)... and never got a text back. Okay... they're probably just busy and/or missed my text. No biggie. Like last week, I saw *something* cool online (ambiguity for anonymity) and sent them a link, saying I'd thought of them. No response at all again. What gives? Maybe they missed it twice, but my socially anxious ass keeps thinking they're just done with me now for some reason.

Next example. I'm really close to this person. Throughout the entire year we worked late into the night together multiple times a week, constantly sent each other memes, talked about things other than studying (I considered that maybe they just thought of me as a study buddy, but I don't think so), etc. etc. For the past week-two weeks, I've been continuing our typical communications (almost daily memes, random thoughts, attempting Facetimes, etc), but they've suddenly just like stopped responding?

As I said, I know that they're probably just busy or something. After all, everybody has their own lives to live. But this has happened with nearly all of my friends (like literally one person has not done this)... so I'm just confused and incredibly anxious about it all of the time. I keep thinking, are these real friends, or just work proximity associates? Do they value me less as a friend than their other friends? 

This has been happening (to a lesser extent, but has been happening nonetheless) since coming here. I've been trying to accept that people are just very busy, but so am I! I still try to reach out/stay in contact, wish them luck before their big exams and events, check in on them, etc. That's not to say that I think I'm a perfect friend–I am absolutely not. It's just to say that I don't understand why they don't respond at all, or at the very least send a text saying ""hey I'm busy rn. I'll respond when I'm not"". Because it's been happening for so long, I'm starting to wonder... is everyone meant to have friends? Like. Is everyone meant to have friends? That's not meant to be as philosophical as it sounds, but instead is supposed to mean, aside from the introvert/extrovert thing, are some people just not built to be friends with others? It feels like that may be the case, though I may just be in my own head.

I don't think this would bother me as much if I still had friends I could talk to. But since it's happening with all of my close friends, and since I'm friends with nobody from my hometown (hurrah for shitty hometowns), I really feel like I can't talk to anybody bc I don't want to just keep spamming them with new messages, hoping they'll respond eventually.

I'm back and, while that grammatical construction still blows and needs to be linguistically prescribed out of existence, this time I have something else I'm annoyed about but to a slightly smaller degree.

I hate it when exercise things tell you to ""engage your core."" It's totally unspecific and not at all intuitive for people who are new to an exercise, AND the actual meaning of the term in the context of the exercise depends on what exercise you are doing.

This post was inspired by me seeing a facebook ad for the skating titled ""Skating Tips from Facebook Skaters Group"" or whatever, where it said ""Tip 1: Engage your core"" followed by a shot of some healthy cute girl just skating normally. It annoyed me because it offered me no helpful information whatsoever. And don't get me started on things I see on instagram or pinterest.

Imagine a professional baseball player, or tennis player, is being coached on how to properly pitch or serve. Imagine if the trainer just said 'Engage your arm"" or ""Engage your shoulder."" What part of the arm or shoulder? At what point during the motion/exercise should I do it??  Am I doing it too early, or using the right muscles of my arm or shoulder at the appropriate time with my motion? The same can be said about the Engage your core line, given the variety of muscles it encompasses and the different ways it is necessary to use them in different contexts.

I'm not a gym pro by any means, let's get that clear, but I've definitely seen people struggle when doing exercises when they are told to engage their core, a lot of times because they think it just means like clench your stomach and it makes breathing harder, but they think that's what you do because ""the core"" of the human body is a generic phrase with no real meaning when the activity you are trying to do requires specifics. The core could be any set of your ab muscles or your hip muscles, and it depends on the specific exercise as to which is the most important, right?? Instead of ""engage your core,"" say for skating, ""Exert your abdominal muscles to maintain balance of your upper body by trying to limit the motion of your upper body."" When teaching people do to floor exercises at home, be more specific, dangit. Describe or show what the actual muscles should be doing. 

So the next time you see some instagram post from a hot person who makes 6 figures being hot on social media telling you to ""engage your core"" as part of their Instagram Influencer Branded Summer Big Booty Exercises At Home video they've posted, don't let them get away with it.

I've contemplated the issue of asian fever and racial fetishization a lot, and I've recently tried to put it in perspective with my own dating history and some of my friends' that I've observed. I think a lot of other asian females can concur they've been a victim of or witnessed asian fever. My music teacher in high school had a very distinct and egregious favoritism for the asian girls in his class. He gave us privileges and put in a lot of time and effort to converse with me and other asian girls. He'd offer rides and food. It was actually a running joke how if you were asian girl, you could skip class or not practice and get away with anything. I've seen several adults as well as kids my age even flaunt how ""woke"" they are for dating a black or brown girl. BIPOC appearances and cultures are tokenized, fetishized, and objectified. It's a problem that runs rampant. For the people feeling sensitive about being a participant in racial fetishization, please know that being made aware of potential issues isn't accusation. 

If your romantic/sexual history seems to objectively reflect a particular preference for a race, it doesn't automatically reflect that your intentions have a more sinister root. However, it is important to introspect and remain self critical. Do you, maybe unconsciously, harbor/internalize some of the more problematic motives/perspectives? And if so, work to address it.

Attraction is strongly rooted in circumstances of exposure and environment. If you grew up exposed predominantly to one ethnicity, or saw portrayals of beauty of predominantly once race, it informs what may find yourself attracted to. I went to a predominantly white/latinx elementary school. My earliest crushes were white/latinx. This blurred over into the beginning of middle school, which was extremely diverse. As a circumstance of classes and club activities, the demographic i was exposed to and spent the most time around shifted.  My crushes in middle school were both asian. In high school, my first ever serious relationship was with a brown guy. After that, I noticed that I more frequently noticed and felt attraction towards brown men. During my relationship, I got extremely problematic comments like ""oh so she likes em dark"". Having positive associations with a person or previous experience can lead you to apply those same positive feelings towards people who more closely resemble them. But its a blurry line between positive association, and potential fetishization. This goes beyond just appearance. The same happens for personality/vibe. Know the line and examine where you stand. It's important to always be checking in with yourself and staying informed.  

As hard as it is, people will make assumptions about your relationship. It can go in all the different ways, with all racial and gender combinations. It must be also be said that if you are not BIPOC, you will be further scrutinized, because of persisting power dynamics. It's tough, but it's important to recognize why that's the case. So many commentors have already explained this in depth. That said, it doesn't give anyone the right to ridicule, harass, or make derogatory statements about you, your partner, or your parents. 

I guess that's my two cents. I'm still learning so please help inform me if some statements I made may have been ignorant or if I failed to consider anything.",39204,

speaking as a legacy whos parents never donated a dime. also as a non-white legacy that for a while was glad to benefit from the process but still disliked something that had a sort of a reputation of being ""affirmative action for rich white kids"" when I was applying... 

i remember being told by my guidance counselors in high school that because my parents never donated anything, legacy doesnt matter. that may be true at other schools, but at princeton specifically at least it does partially affect how your application is reviewed. For instance, iirc, regular applicants get 2 readers, and given some condition (both readers approved? it was split? i forget at this point) you get a third reader that can either say reject or accept and from there i don't really know what happens (I think you get discussed further alongside other applicants but dont quote me on this). As a legacy, you are guaranteed three readers, and princeton will even send you a letter in the mail confirming this. in all honesty, this might be simply to appease parents who want their kids to go to princeton, but it does prevent you from getting unlucky if one of your two readers was in a bad mood when they read your application. tbh if you're already really qualified i don't think it will make that big of a difference. there's a statistic that i think ~30% of legacies get in or something, but it's important not to take that at face value. a lot of that has to do with the bias of growing up in (likely) an intellectual household with a lot of resources because your parents went to princeton (good home environment, likely an emphasis on academics, maybe money for private school, ability to pay and retake standardized tests, the list goes on and on). plenty of legacies get denied, so unless ur family donated a lot I don't see legacy being something that will get an unqualified candidate into princeton, but I don't work in admissions.

i could be projecting but in case you are a legacy thats wondering if they deserved to get in, i'm sure you were. that being said, a lot of people deserved to get in and didnt. not to overgeneralize, but it's best to be very aware of the privileges princeton legacies are likely to benefit from beyond just admissions. living in households that have princeton graduates as parents tends to come with a lot of benefits that are very easy to take for granted if you grew up with them... imo legacy shouldn't even be a thing and hopefully by the time our kids are applying to college, there wont be any benefits for legacies in the admissions process, even if it is just a third reader.

being a legacy is like the equivalent of eating a good breakfast and being driven by your parents to the track stadium for a race, when many of your competitors had to walk 10 miles uphill on an empty stomach just to get to the start line. sure, maybe legacies get to start 4 inches in front of everyone else, but if you're slow as fuck you probably won't win the race either way. what makes legacy acceptance rates higher isn't the small advantage you got in the application process, its all the disadvantages you didnt have to experience leading up to it. of course legacies acceptance rates are so high, its stacked in their favor.

as an asian woman, i’m getting sick of having to defend myself to anonymous white man after white man sharing their latest take on “i’m not racist/that’s not racist/your experienced and valid points are wrong bc my perspective says otherwise”

yes, not all asian women are bothered by this, and nowhere near the majority of wmaf are problematic. that doesn’t mean it’s a nonexistent problem and it doesn’t mean we can’t assume it’s a possibility. and don’t even get me started on how some of you don’t even seem to understand that this is not an equal power dynamic. the blame is never on an asian woman for “letting herself be fetishized” or “being a hypocrite for calling out yellow fever while dating white guys and not asians”.

6/21/2021 1:44:26,"Here’s an Asian male perspective to add to the noise. It seems like very attractive Asian women are drawn to mid tier attractive white men. This is very obviously not the origin of yellow fever but it could be part of what maintains it. Asian males tend to get frustrated with this, because it feels like we have to look like a kpop star for any Asian girl to even be remotely interested in us, whereas they seem to fall for an average looking white guy over a more attractive Asian guy. This trend where Asian men are not considered attractive overall carries across racial groups. A great example of this is that the two groups with the least matches on dating apps are black women and Asian men. I don’t think we should attack or judge Asian women  for dating white men, and this shouldn’t take away from the conversation of yellow fever, which is a problem. But I think there is something to be said about how much white skin is valued in all communities of color and how it shouldn’t be. ",39222,

And then i was like wait I've never dated anyone black. And then i was like well but I also haven't dated a ton of people, maybe this would be weird if i had ten exes but this doesn't mean that much.

Anyway, I’ve lived in multiple states and throughout my life I’ve noticed that most minority groups tend to coalesce into friend groups that mostly fit their race (as one would expect). However, I haven’t seen it as a phenomenon as pronounced as it is among East Asian Americans, especially Korean Americans, even compared to other minority groups, such as Black Americans, South Asian Americans, Latino Americans, etc.

 In many places I lived, even where East Asians or Koreans weren’t a sizeable minority, it wasn’t rare to see large friend groups, often upwards of 10-15 people, composed of almost entirely East Asians (nothing inherently wrong with that!). The only place I might have lived where I didn’t observe it as much might be Texas, where friend groups were often a mix of East and South Asians.

Anyway, to my East Asian friends, for you personally, do you have any guess as to what might be the cause of this? I don’t expect anyone to know the exact cause whatever it may be, but I tried to find articles on this, and couldn’t find any. Thanks so much guys!!",39246,

I think OP is not saying sexuality is a choice (they used poor word choice), but rather conditioned. if all human behaviors are genetic or learned, and sexuality definitely isn't genetic, it must be learned. That's not to say it's a choice, but it's something you develop as you grow. OP is just questioning the default for us to be heterosexual and how historically many ancient cultures indulged in sex with all people regardless of gender or sex, it was only the rise of the Abrahamic religions that conditioned and imposed heterenormativity onto most of the world. OP is seeing this shift as a choice (again, poor word choice) made by humanity from what they consider, and probably was, the norm - having sex with everyone.",39270,

6/22/2021 10:37:31,"Something I've been thinking about lately is how, when Europe replaced monarchy with liberalism and slowly liberal democracy, it was supposed to ""equalize"" things and give all people to chance to govern themselves, but if you read some political philosophy, a lot of the famous political people, Mill, etc, actually saw that there would be a new ""monarchy class,"" but instead of hereditary rule, it would be rule by those who are the most industrious or intelligent. Liberal capitalist societies didn't change anything but who was in charge (and it's arguably hereditary anyway).

And by our virtue of being at Princeton, we are part of the select group having been chosen to become the elite. Even as that status intersects with people of different means and backgrounds, Princeton basically is like we receive knighthood or lordship, but in a modern liberal and capitalist sense. Why does society need to be this way? Is it not that deep bro?",39273,

however, i just wanted to say that you should not ever be ashamed of saying something dumb or being wrong about something! (unless of course you made a hurtful or bigoted comment, but that isn't what i'm talking about, these deleted comments were super innocuous.) just listen to and learn from the people saying you might not have fully thought something through! that's how we grow! nothing to be ashamed of! 

also, someone leaving up when they were wrong about something would make me respect them more, whereas deleting your mistakes comes off as trying to hide them (which is understandable but still uncool) or caring more about your social media rep (on a very silly page!) than learning from mistakes. also, consider that when you delete your comment, you also delete all replies, making it impossible for these (almost always respectful, helpful, and interesting) exchanges to be of value for others. you have the right to delete your comments if you choose, but why should you have the power to delete someone else's, especially if the exchange was useful?",39281,

So this bitch of a PSE&G worker comes and knocks on the door, saying that he's here to fix something in the garage that we never asked for. My mom goes out to explain to him that we never asked for him to come, and next thing I know, he's yelling at my mom, bitching and mansplaining about how we're 'supposed' to know that and literally shouting my mom down.  In the end, he just left all angry and shit muttering stuff about asians whatever. First off I hate that I just stood there and watched the whole fucking thing happen, and second I wanted to literally sock his face inside out. Every time something like this happens, I am reminded of how on a daily basis, white men are able to fucking TRAMPLE on BIPOC, especially women and nonbinary people, like they're somehow fucking superior to us. I know I shouldn't generalize, but i've seen white cishet men trample over BIPOC around me enough to know that there's a PATTERN. I can understand that he's a tired electrician who doesn't like his job, but that doesn't mean he can be such a fucking BITCH to a customer. This may be one small incident that'll at best leave me irked for a day, but this sort of experience compounding over days, weeks, years, even decades is what's wrong with this fucking country.

6/23/2021 2:08:51,"I'm sad. A fun fact about me is that on the day I was accepted into Princeton, I weighed 77.6 pounds. Then online Princeton happened, and despite what y'all will say about the dining hall food, I managed to gain almost fifty pounds on wucox chicken and rice.

Now I'm back to my original weight, but the problem is, almost all the fat I've gained has accumulated on my belly. I'm really embarrassed about it, especially stressed about what my friends will think of it, since it protrudes so much. I can't wear a lot of my clothes, even my pre-ED ones, since my belly bulge is just so prominent. I really look like I'm nine months pregnant, but I swear there's no baby.

In spite of this all, I still have chronic headaches, constant fatigue, amenorrhea, and depression. I've started thinking about how wonderful it would be if I wouldn't wake up, not because I actively want to die, but because it is so painful to get through life every day, with a throbbing headache and mental fog that seems to only be getting worse. I'm incredibly stressed out for the next semester, both because of my body dysmorphia but also because I'm almost entirely dysfunctional and it's so difficult to even be awake, let along think. I want to lie in bed all day, but I hate it; I used to be incredibly energetic and motivated, but I don't know how to become that person again. It's so depressing to be self-aware while I'm crying about how I can't do anything about my mental state, and wishing I was somewhere else or just entirely gone. I know I'm really fortunate in a lot of ways but I feel like my brain has just shut down and refused to continue, deciding my life is over in my teens.

Currently, I'm trying to diet using keto, eating between 1400-1800 a day (pretty sure I'm counting right), but the amount of exercise I'm doing is becoming absurd again, 500-800 just from cardio alone (based on distance/weight), along with weight training and abs every day. But the number on the scale just isn't budging and I am so frustrated, I just want my friends to not think I'm pregnant when I get back. I know some of my fatigue might be because of diet, but I never felt this lethargic, even at my lowest weight, and conversely, I felt similarly even when I was bingeing crazy amounts of food during the semester. 

Have seen two doctors, one a specialist, who were more than useless. The first prescribed anti-depressants that have turned my brain fog into splitting headaches, and the second one essentially said ""huh, IDK"". I stumbled across this article, https://edinstitute.org/blog/2011/9/14/i-need-how-many-calories
which I can't determine is BS or not (all due respect), because ngl, most people I knew at Princeton seemed to survive on two pancakes for breakfast, a chicken nugget for lunch, and three fries for dinner this semester. Would see people take a bite of chicken at the dhalls, decide it was gross, and toss the rest. At first, I kept trying to convince myself that everyone had massive stockpiles of food in their rooms, but I found out this wasn't exactly true. With two years of ED, it was really hard for me to have an intuitive sense for what normal people ate in a day, and I was wondering why I was eating five times as much as everyone. To this day, I can't figure out whether y'all are thermodynamic miracles, or if the recommenced daily calorie intake has an extra zero in it. I'm sorry that this is all over the place and I hope I'm not offending anyone, but trying to ""eat intuitively"" just led to BED, and I honestly was and still am really confused about how much I should be eating to maintain a healthy, normal weight. 

I don't think my present form of exercise and diet is sustainable at all, and my endocrine function is still broken despite having been weight recovered for months. I'm embarrassed about how I'm allowing exercise to take over my life but I can't lose the weight, but I don't know how to break out of this cycle, and I also don't know how to eat less to compensate, given I'm barely maintaining right now. I guess I'm just hoping for a success story from someone who's been through this (period loss, no energy, looks more pregnant than actual pregnant women on IG) and come out the other side to let me know there is a light at the end of the tunnel (my CPS therapist was so VAGUE about her past cases), or advice, or if anyone is kind and comfortable enough to share what they actually eat in a day, any would be deeply appreciated. :)

I've had this exact experience and I know how stressful it can be, but I promise that it's not nearly as noticeable as you think and it will go away soon! What you're describing (the so-called anorexia tummy) is normal when your body is recovering from long periods of starvation and is very common in anorexia recovery. I'm not a doctor obviously but from my understanding your body is storing as much fat as possible around your abdomen to protect your organs because you've been in starvation mode for so long (I probably explained it very poorly but if you look it up there are articles about this). Anyways, the point is, as counterintuitive as it may be, your belly won't go away if you keep restricting your calories. After you're fully recovered (your period back, your metabolism back to normal, etc) that weight will redistribute, but your body needs to heal first, just being weight restored won't do. I'm not sure if you're on the Princeton Body Positivity slack but if you need support from other people with similar experiences you should definitely join!

Terrified my depression will come back worse again, that I’ll relapse, that I’ll fail more classes.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/715141
Abstract: Physical attractiveness is an important axis of social stratification associated with educational attainment, marital patterns, earnings, and more. Still, relative to ethnoracial and gender stratification, physical attractiveness is relatively understudied. In particular, little is known about whether returns to physical attractiveness vary by race or significantly vary by race and gender combined. In this study, we use nationally representative data to examine whether (1) socially perceived physical attractiveness is unequally distributed across race/ethnicity and gender subgroups and (2) returns to physical attractiveness vary significantly across race/ethnicity and gender subgroups. Notably, the magnitude of the earnings disparities along the perceived attractiveness continuum, net of controls, rivals and/or exceeds in magnitude the black-white race gap and, among African-Americans, the black-white race gap and the gender gap in earnings. The implications of these findings for current and future research on the labor market and social inequality are discussed.

i actually feel like you are with my ex, as in literally? he never hit me, but def did other awful things... why i think you u r with my ex:

had an issue with alcohol for one, and no matter what you say he felt it was his right tor be able to choose to drink and telling him otherwise wasn't okay

and very weirdly, loved being in hot and humid temps, we fought over temp a lot 
i had forgotten something and he was driving me back to get it back. so like in a joking way turned the heat on the car all the way up and locked the windows on a day when it was like 78 and humid. It was a bit scary and looking back even though it was a ""joke"" in the context of all the other abuse it was a power trip for him to make me feel uncomfortable

finally, someone started dating my ex in 2020...

as for your feelings, this is what i did to get out of the relationship,
a therapist helps a lot and mine told me, ""your body knows, even if you don't"". So like yeah your body is reacting this way to his touch because it is no longer attracted to him, wants nothing to with him. Your body reacts faster than you can sometimes consciously think so you have already lost a lot of intimacy to him even if he is ""older and hotter"" also it took me time to actually break up with him, it's okay to take that, but please do it sooner if the abuse escalates, and it, unfortunately, will

you'll feel a lot of things getting out this, but if you are stuck on the reason of conventional attractiveness, let's say the next person is lesser attractive conventionally, at least YOU will feel attraction to them, while you currently have none. And what helps that attraction and connection is someone who respects you. You have so much more waiting for you when you let him go, i'm still working to get there, but I have already gained so much.

i also mean this in the kindest way, if you think that i know your ex and you think you know me....
please do not reach out to me
there are better resources and im still healing and this close connection to my ex would be traumatic to my healing, im already worried about posting this

Speaking from personal experience here, I hope this can help you in some way.

To be honest, a lot fewer people will ask ""oh why'd you break up/stay"" than you would think. even if they do you can always preface your answer to anyone's questions/tell friends before they ask that you'd just rather not talk about it because it was difficult for you. and if you're afraid of word traveling (it very very likely will not unless you put it out there somehow), a bonus is that if it does people tend not to ask you about it. 

friends can be helpful support systems but certainly shouldn't be the main branch of your healing. Leaning on them too hard can cause problems. Therapy or working on yourself through whatever means necessary - like meditation, lifestyle changes (geared towards self-improvement), and picking up more hobbies, these helped me - may be more important for you than leaning on friends through your healing journey. You can be ready and do it at your own pace. I know it sounds difficult, isolation and the loneliness that comes with it are common reasons one may stay. 

This may sound ridiculous now but time really does heal wounds. It can be slow at first and then all at once you haven't thought about him in months. He's not better than you for being ""older"" or ""better looking,"" he's not settling for you. He's capable of doing awful things to people he claims to love and is burdening you with a secret you did not choose to have. 

I will say those statements make it sound as if this relationship may have impacted your confidence (very normal and not your fault - emotional abuse often accompanies physical) - or you've otherwise had troubles with self-esteem (which is also very normal and he's taken advantage of that if he's told you he's better than you or you dont deserve him). There have been studies that find people in abusive relationships tend to see more positive aspects of the relationship while still in it, and fewer after leaving.

I've been there - and I can also tell you my confidence has gone through the roof since leaving. I'm more confident than ever before in my life. I cannot describe how much better it gets. You can do this. I also hadn't broken up with anyone before and had attachment issues - I wish I recognized that this was holding me back. 

You deserve a fulfilling and happy future, better than whatever future you imagine he can be a part of - and you can get there yourself. You can get out. I believe in you. I would help you if there was any way I could. 

You can use services like womanspace - there a lot of free and discrete resources out there. I've heard they can help you get out but can't speak to the experience. Advocates were always very kind to me, though. ",39452,

I've never really coded before college, but I'm teaching myself algorithms and data structures in python and R. I know for sure how to do the math behind it (dynamic programming, etc.) and for the most part working on code. I have decent experience in math -- MAT215/217/ORF363 and expect to take MAT320, MAT300 and ECE435 next semester, and MAT490 and ORF309 after that. I do know basic probability theory that I've picked up on my spare time, and am currently reading up on the ORF309 lecture notes to prepare myself in that regard

I was thinking COS484 would broaden my insight on NLP, but my fear is that it seems coding heavy and I will get muscled out by the coding whizzes there as someone that mainly uses STATA, MATLAB and R.

I did say that a lot of the quote unquote more richer and flavorful dishes are Mughlai and I stand by that. Taste is subjective and sometimes it’s much tastier and fulfilling to have simple curd rice versus like a biryani or korma but historically there is an ingredient quality and complexity difference between food eaten by royals and those by ordinary folk, like the difference between brioche that were eaten by those in Versailles vs the ordinary bread loaves eaten by normal folk. Also nothing in my original message was supposed to be dismissive of other royals in Indian history; I merely said that many of the most common dishes in Indian restaurants are Mughlai and were manufactured to be delicious for a specific historical reason. Although it should be more that, arguably, at least as it pertains to North Indian cuisine, there were no royals after the Mughals (definitely were many before though) that had a culinary impact the way the chefs of Mughal kitchens did on non-daily Indian food (e.g. food eaten during festivals, ceremonies, weddings, etc). Also, correct me if I’m wrong, but the Central Asian impact on Mughlai is fairly minimal. The Mughal rules were fairly assimilated into Indian society in most things except for some, most notably religion, by the time of Akbar.",39474,

6/30/2021 2:55:14,"im in a bit of a dilemma. there are these two people who have expressed to me last semester that they would be open to dating me if things were to align.i wasnt really in the right headspace then, but now im getting to a point where i can kind of see myself in a relationship and my mind keeps getting drawn to these two people. I don't really like the idea of ""choosing"" since i value their individual autonomy so much, and theyre two of my really close friends, but for the sake of this tiger confession i was wondering if i could get some input. 

person 1 is electrifying. there is never a dull moment with them, and we can banter like crazy. but its not superficial, we can have deep talks just as easily as joke filled ones, and sitting in silence with them is also a very comforting presence. I feel open to be entirely myself even if parts of me are a lil cringy. theres def some sexual tension in our interactions, but we both respected our friendship enough to never really do anything about it. i look forward to every time we make plans, and would rearrange my schedule to hang out with them. I could definitely see myself dating this person and it being really fun and enjoyable. it feels like i've known this person my entire life and its still not boring. 

person 2 makes me feel so unbelievably cared for. they are single handedly the most attentive person i know. they somehow manage to remember all the little things i tell them, and even check in days or weeks later. they are someone i can recharge with. i love spending downtime with them, even if the conversation doesnt flow, its comforting just seeing them and coexisting with them. i think we both care for each other deeply; random midnight gifts for each other or calling to hang out just because they were in the area. i think our relationship is strongly platonic at the moment, not really sexually charged at all, but i think the extent to which we express our affections would likely have to change if either of us had an SO. if i dated this person, we probably wouldnt be super physical or anything, but i would be comforted knowing that this person would always have my back.

6/30/2021 13:02:13,"Seeing the emails about SHARE's The Way You Move reminds me something that continues to concern me both about Princeton and modern day consent-based sex ed, which is that, while consent based sex ed is incredibly important in a modern context, I think we overlook that it is somewhat insufficient for truly healthy relationships.

I just read this wapo article about some country singer's song called ""Modest is Hottest,"" which was apparently tongue in cheek, but it set off old complaints about purity culture, like how it centers men, puts the onus on women, and has a sort of ""Prosperity Gospel"" to it in that one is taught if they wait and be modest now, you will be rewarded in the future with an incredible sex life. Don't worry, I definitely am not saying the consent training is as bad as this, far from it. But I feel like from both the content of the things we learn at Princeton as well as seeing how my friends at Princeton have struggled, consent based sex ed and sex resources often have a sort of inverse ""prosperity gospel,"" wherein we are taught, perhaps not directly, that if we utilize consent as a framework for our relationships, with the usual base framework of hookups, we will be rewarded with healthy relationships, or at least we assume that it will naturally lead to healthy relationships and is sufficient. In my experience, people walk away having received that implication, whether intended or not.

I just graduated this spring, and for just as many of my friends and acquaintances of varying sexualities and identities that I know that have dealt with sexual assault and harassment (sadly not zero!!), I can name just as many whose romantic or kinda sexual, kinda romantic relationships have contributed to deteriorating mental health, been very unhealthy from the get-go, caused them to have worse academic performance, or have worsened their self image and body image. This is not an exhaustive list, but things that my friends (and even me) have struggled with include: not knowing how to end a relationship either through lack of knowing how to communicate or because they feel unsafe doing so or think it will lead to ""social death""; tying their self-worth to a relationship/SO; inability to communicate preferences or feelings to a partner (they might partake in consent still, but the person doesn't know how to communicate/doesn't have the confidence to explain what they want to the other person); not knowing *HEALTHY* strategies to process through a breakup, which has been especially bad for my friends who already have other mental health issues; lack of active listening/healthy communication skills from either or both people in relationships; feeling as if they have been taken advantage of, especially in short, weeks long fling type situations (one person has a much stronger early emotional investment which the other uses, perhaps not even maliciously, to have more sex,etc, which I've seen cause a lot of pain and trauma for the emotionally invested one once the other loses interest)

I'm not trying to compare the ""badness"" of these two categories of things or try to pit them against each other, obviously some of these things are far more traumatic than others! But, at least in my experience, it feels like emotional, communicative, and relational issues are just as common, if not more common, in my friend and acquaintance circle while I was at Princeton, and they can still have a really big impact on people's lives while they study here. I've seen friends go through serious trauma, especially those who already struggle with mental health issues and self worth issues, and it seems like they often just don't have any experience with relationship skills or lack communication skills. It's great that they know about consent but people are actual people and are far more complex, it's not enough to just have this as our education, right? And a lot of these things are skills you need to learn. If you aren't taught them, you may never learn them to begin with, or will only learn them through trial by fire.

Even Tiger Confessions seems reflective of this. There are lots of tiger confessions by people who are looking for help in their relationships, struggling to process things, feeling emotionally manipulated, who demonstrate a lack of emotional/communicative/relational education or understanding not by their own fault. There is a tragic common theme that many people don't know where to turn to or how to work through their situations, which is why they turn to TC for advice. I feel like it doesn't need to be this way. Are shitty relationships to the extent that they exist now just a fact of life? I don't think so. I am not blaming anyone for like intentionally overlooking these issues to be clear, since I think society as a whole, especially modern day sex ed type stuff, doesn't do the best job explaining them. [Ironically, the two people I know who got the most relationship and communication education, advice, and counseling were people who were in religious groups on campus, since the religious leaders in them often talk about these things.] We have so much stuff going over consent, which is great. Lots of first year orientation stuff, mandatory eating club things each year, stuff through ODUS and more. Obviously it's been a long time since I was a first year, so maybe they have improved in this regard. I hope so. But as long as we continue to overlook or choose not to prioritize healthy relationship skills, I worry that people will continue to suffer unnecessarily in relationships too. ",39503,

There have definitely been times when I've gotten unsatisfactory yet deserved grades, and times I've needed to change the way I study and do classes. But there are other times where I've felt really unfairly graded and treated by my professors - times where the grading has felt murky, imbalanced, and arbitrary. To be honest, I hate how classes are here. I feel like I've developed an expectation of mediocrity because none of my hard work seems to pay off. I'm just always mediocre.

thats why there is great utility in learning to forget. once you have stopped pouring over each laugh and touch, only then can you truly be free to move on. our allegiance to the happy memories we have leads to a vision of the future thats is full of false expectation and purpose. there is more to love than times of happiness. 

recently, i have been suffering with this great sorrow. every moment i think of the future’s brightness, past promises of forever love accuse me of betrayal. i wish with all of my heart to confront the injustices of breaking up, but at the back of my mind I know that all I want to do is hold on to something that doesn’t exist anymore.

there is no easy way to forget. all I can do is make my pretenses of normality reality - a painful but necessary process. yet those pretenses are more real than the memories I cling to. i’m moving from one illusion to another - one that will free me from what i was losing and lost. this self destruction is a slow metamorphosis to new life and love, a love unburdened by incompleteness.",39528,

7/2/2021 3:02:07,"Re: 39449 and it’s comments-

As a half Asian actress who has been told her whole life by Asian family, friends, and scene partners that she’s white passing. And then told by white casting directors, acting coaches, and agents that she’s ethnically ambiguous, I would just like to say that being white passing has given me certain advantages. However, it has certainly had its fair share of setbacks that non mixed people will never understand. And I’m honestly so sick and tired of people demanding I not only acknowledge but also atone for my privilege by regulating my behavior and the stories I tell. Do you know what it’s like not to be accepted by either ethnic group to which you belong? Do you know what it’s like walking into Chinese Student Association initiations and having people glare at you, look you up and down, and ask “so you’re half right?” Do you know what it’s like going to Chinese school every Saturday since you were 6 and not be accepted into any friend groups because they know your dad is white? Do you know what it’s like to have white agents and casting directors tell you at 12 years old that while you’re talented enough to get cast, no one will ever cast you because you confuse the audience when cast as white or as Asian and there are no roles for mixed actors? Do you know what it’s like to watch the rare canonically half-Asian characters on screen be cast with entirely Asian actors because if mixed people are cast to play ourselves we aren’t Asian enough to appeal to the wider Asian American market? I understand that I have privilege, I really do. My confusing appearance protects me from a lot of the violence that non-mixed people have to face. However, when I look at 39449, the reply and some of comments, I am reminded that there are people who will resent me for just existing, and there is no cultural place or community for people like me where we can feel safe and won’t have our race put on trial all the time. And that there will always be people who see me as an unfortunate byproduct of just another sick white man fetishizing and objectifying my mother instead of the loving relationship that it is (not to say that those kinds of toxic relationships don’t exist but the fact that we as a family continue to face that assumption is frustrating). And is there really space for me in the industry I grew up in and fell in love with? No. Because people like me don’t count as representation. Because there’s no pleasing people who dislike the fact that you exist. There’s no amount of acknowledgement that will make my existence okay. There’s no amount of explanation that will excuse me using any of my family history from either side in any story I tell because I can never be right. I tell the stories of my grandmother teaching me calligraphy and I am not Asian enough to tell that story. I tell the stories of baking cookies and pies for thanksgiving at my grandad’s house in Virginia and I am allowing myself to be whitewashed. Thank you to the people who stood up in the comments for me and my fellow mixed “white passing” Asian Americans to not get pushed out of Asian communities. Sorry for the post length ",39549,

What it is tbh is nothing more than an excessive rant that shows OPs own insecurities at having white privilege. You were bullied by 6 year old kids in Chinese school for not being of full Asian descent? Why are you extending the blame to Asians in general? You were cast out of playing Asian characters because you were half white? Why the fuck do Asians get the blame for that? I'm sorry but if you really want to blame yourself for who you are, why not blame your mother for marrying your white father? Why do you think you have such a right to positions where Asians without white ancestry are constantly being overlooked? Do you not see how you having a white father puts you further in the door than I will ever get? I'll give you a quick example. Take Thai cinema. Do you not think its slightly odd that in Thailand (where less than 0.5% of the population is half white and half Thai) that the current leading lights and highest paid stars of its acting industry (Mario Maurer and Davika Hoorne) both have white fathers? Dont even get me started on the casting of half whites in filipino cinema. But do you seriously think there is a level playing field for actors of full Asian descent vs those who have white ancestry? Why do you think you have an automatic right to Asian acting roles? You should have automatic access to roles where the character is mixed, I agree. But to other Asian acting roles? No, sorry it does not work like that. You can blame our white-dominated society if these kinds of roles are hard to come by. As a parting note, being mixed white and Asian does not equal being born to 2 Asian parents however much you may want it to. You should celebrate your own unique ethnic/racial heritage.

Like if I were to pay for the visit fees, I would've made a different choice, such as waiting to see the doctor after my insurance was active. for example if I went to a grocery store and they checked idk a coupon or something and told me ok with this coupon it will be 20 dollars but at the end of the day they realize they made a mistake, I doubt they'll call me and be like hey come back and pay the remaining fees. But also medical offices are different.

7/4/2021 11:56:08,"My girlfriend and I have been dating since freshman year (we're rising juniors), but I'm having strange feelings that might mean we should break up. I am looking for advice hopefully other than ""communication"" because I am somewhat certain that if I bring this up, our relationship will take a bad turn which might be avoidable. Of course if the consensus is to bring it up with her, I will. Here is the my situation:

I love my girlfriend, we communicate very well and have both been completely loyal while we've dated. I have loved the comfort and security of our relationship, especially through the pandemic. However, now that things are slowly opening back up, I am remembering how much I used to enjoy flirting with, courting/pursuing women (usually just for hookups or fwb situations, not actual serious relationships). 

I would obviously never do this while in a loving relationship, but I can feel myself wanting to go talk to that girl at the bar, or send that text to an old hookup from high school in a way I haven't before. Of course I value my relationship with her much more than I do a random hookup, but I also don't want to lie to myself and say I'm not having these feelings. I know how insanely lucky I am to be in such a great relationship but I want to be as fair to my girlfriend as possible. 

I feel I have three options: 
1. Tell her exactly what I'm feeling and risk her thinking I just want to break up (I'm not sure how else you could take that information)
2. Suck it up, ignore those thoughts, and appreciate our relationship for as long as I can
3. Break up sooner rather than later and potentially spare her of a more emotionally taxing breakup down the line due to my emotional immaturity

Can anyone with relationship experience relate? I would love some help - thanks",39602,

Ross Butler, Charles Melton, Henry Golding, and a bunch of other half white Asian actors have been chosen to play roles over full Asians, and the fact that Dr. Strange and other movies have been white-washed is proof that white privilege is very much prevalent in the movie industry. It's also much rarer for mixed Asian roles to get casted by full Asians than vice versa. I'm sorry that OP of #39549 had to face the difficulties that she did feeling like an outsider to two different communities, but it sounds like she thinks full Asians have it easier when it comes to breaking into the industry when it's not. Also, the original post she was addressing had to due with feeling uncomfortable with mixed Asians profiting off of perpetuating Asian stereotypes, and I think it's fair for full Asians to feel uncomfortable about that.

7/6/2021 8:21:57,"re 39613: Just wanted to point out the inherently flawed assumption that whenever a mixed Asian person gets cast, they are somehow stealing roles that were set aside for ""full"" Asians. (Ross Butler did an interview that explicitly stated that the role he went in for did not specify what race they wanted, however I will admit that the Crazy Rich Asians role should have gone to a ""full"" Asian person because that is the way the role is written in the novel) And also wanted to call out the assumption that casting mixed Asians at all is somehow equally bad as casting a full white person in a role where the original text (i.e. the comic book or novel the film or TV script was based on) explicitly stated the character was ""full"" Asian. In addition, how many roles do you see in American TV  or film that were originally written for a half-Asian person? (I can think of one, Lara Jean in To All the Boys I've Loved before, where they cast a ""full"" asian person as the lead even though both in the original novel and the film, her mixed identity is a huge part of the plot and story-line. And honestly? Thats just not a big enough sample size for me to say either way that it’s much more or less common for “full” asians to get cast as mixed asians.) Most of the time when a mixed person gets cast, it is in a role where the casting call specifically was looking for all races and ethnicities, and that mixed person just so happened to get the role and then they wrote the script around them the same way they did for Dusty in stranger things to accommodate his disability. So while Mixed Asians clearly have privilege in overseas markets, they tend to struggle in American ones. In addition, both this submission and the post that 39549 was replying to continue to heavily imply that when Mixed Asians create their own content about their Asian culture and experiences they had growing up, they are somehow profiting off of perpetuating stereotypes of Asians because they aren't ""asian enough"" to talk about their own lives.

I do agree there is a lot more rhetoric in the form of acceptance and acknowledgement of low income individuals than the same of high income students, but I feel like that is a cultural thing for a few reasons. First of all I think it’s okay to assume that low income individuals need more help, at least in this specific field, in terms of acceptance in the wider Princeton social circle, and that to some extent people acknowledge that and over-provide. I also think that low income people in my experience tend to help eachother and band together more (maybe directly because of their situations) than others, and this may end up looking like there is more support going to low income than high income people.

There’s something that’s been haunting me for the past several months, and I feel it’s finally time I get it off my chest. 

As you all know, the University implemented many policies this past semester to ensure compliance with health guidelines; in order to be allowed on campus, we had to sign the “Social Contract.” 

One of the measures the University took to ensure social distancing was to close off every other bathroom stall. 

Well, one day, after having a large burrito for breakfast, I felt as if my stomach was about to explode; I rushed to the bathroom to take care of business, but, to my horror, all the stalls were occupied!—besides the closed ones, of course, whose posters read: “Not in use to ensure social distancing.” 

As an honorable Princeton student I would never dream of violating the Social Contract and putting my peers at risk of contracting COVID-19, so I waited patiently for one of the stalls to become available. 

After about 10 minutes of waiting, however, I couldn’t contain myself anymore, and I realized I had only precious seconds until I would soil myself. So, in the heat of the moment, I burst into one of the the “closed” stalls and let out one of the largest logs mankind has seen. 

Ever since this episode I have been plagued with insurmountable guilt and agony. How could I have violated the trust the University placed in me? How could I have felt that not shitting myself was more important than putting my peers at risk? How is what I did any different than violating the Honor Code, which warrants a minimum one year suspension? 

I’ve sought comfort and advice from many professionals and friends, but they all brush it off as “shit happens.” I feel that posting here may finally bring me some closure. I know, however, that there is no excuse for what I did, and I will have to live with it for the rest of my days.",39675,

7/7/2021 0:57:48,"Re: #39661

So do you want your pronouns to other you and set you apart, or do you want to normalize the act of not assuming someone's gender orientation? Because the whole point of everyone putting pronouns in their bios is so that we don't misgender people -- not necessarily to compensate for all the misgendering that has happened in the past. Plus, there are ways for non-cis people to stand out and be recognized for their gender identity unrelated to pronouns. I actually think takes like yours are, in fact, detracting from the much-needed normalization of non-traditional gender identities, as well as solidarity within the community of nonbinary people, trans people, and allies that is necessary right now.

7/7/2021 21:55:49,"How wealthy is Princeton? Here is some context, and I hope it will help people like that one OP who thinks being wealthy is a burden or something understand:

I am a recent alum, and my starting job salary is about 70,000 dollars with benefits.

My family's combined household income is today about 115,000. The parent with the highest salary is mid 60s, so I make more than them. When I entered college, my household's income was closer to about 95k.

I grew up in a small town in rural america. Based on my family income, we would be in the top 15, maybe 20%. We didn't and still don't spend lavishly and have to budget things for my family size (I have siblings) but we never had to worry about going broke or my parents not being able to retire as long as their investments didn't collapse or something. I'm not a FLI student. In my community, I was relatively well off. After graduating though, I basically make as much as my parent with the highest income.

And yet....

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/princeton-university
The most recent data you can find about Princeton's median family income of student family is 186k. Now, I'll concede this is a few years old and Princeton has accepted more FLI students since then, so let's just say it's 160k to be fair.

A student like me, at the time of entering, was probably at about the 33% mark. 2/3 of students come from places more wealthy than I. This is me, a student from a family who has stable jobs, grew up in a small town in a more rural part of the US, whose parents went to college and don't have crippling debt. I was one of the ""winners"" of my town. But at Princeton I was nowhere close.

Think about how insane that is. The families of about half of students here make THREE times the median American family (mid 60s). The implications of this follow naturally: students here are overwhelmingly selected from wealthy slices of America, where they are surrounded by those also who are wealthy and fortunate. These are the places where the best schools are, etc., and the best jobs that Princeton students' parents have.

So when people say that being ""low income"" is ""normal"" or something, I hope you understand that where most people who go here (and other elite schools tbf) come from are not normal. They are not the normal US American experience. This is why it is so hard to be a FLI student at this school. I'm not going to pretend I fully understand their experience, but this fact of Princeton demographics is part of the reason why there are so many resources for them.",39714,

This series of confessions is extremely illuminating of how prejudiced so many of y'all are against people who are [white and another] mixed race.""  There are a lot of racist and colorist structures present in society, and being white passing, by definition, allows you to avoid this systemic racism.  Obviously no one has it easy ""in all areas of life"", but race is less of a barrier if you are white-passing.  As for the last comment, I want to point out that it is EXTREMELY valid for white-mixed POC to express their struggles (and I express my deepest warmth to the OP regarding her acting situation a few posts back), but also in the light of the more extreme oppression non-white-mixed POC face, statements along the lines of ""this isn't Oppression Olympics"" can be seen as dismissive of non-white-mixed POC struggles (and is likely why there are many passionate reactions stemming about this topic).

7/9/2021 15:26:42,"As a straight girl, I get kinda conflicted about what I want in a partner. Like I really want a guy who is okay with me breaking societal norms expected of women (perhaps by making more money than him). I want them to see me as strong and capable of taking care of myself. But like I also want a gentleman who treats me like a lady in certain (not financial) ways?? Like I want the experience of being treated super politely and being taken on a traditional date. My ex was close to everything I described except the gentleman part. His politics heavily influenced the way he conducted himself, and so he made an effort to treat everyone kind of ""equally."" But being treated in the same way as all of his friends left me feeling very empty and undesired. I definitely want to be my partner's friend and I want him to feel comfortable being himself around me, but I don't want to be the butt of your bro-y jokes! I love video games, but I also want to be taken out on a real date, not just sit around and play video games all the time!! I want roses on valentines day!!! Whenever I expressed these things to him, he said I was indoctrinated with the desires that I ""should"" have as a woman in a capitalist society. Ironically, I feel like him brushing off what I believe goes against his philosophy by disregarding any agency I have over my own desires. Overall I understood this experience as me wanting more of a traditional gentleman without any of the possibly problematic parts of that. Anyway thank you for reading and have a nice day <3",39759,

a while back, someone told me that they’d gotten raped. it had been sitting with them for a while, but (if i’m remembering correctly) they said it was something they hadn’t really opened up about yet. admittedly, i’m not proud of the way i responded. i listened carefully and of course i believed them, but was just silent for a bit. i should have thanked them for opening up to me and tried my best to make them feel comfortable and safe. i apologized about that later, bc i should have done better. a few months later (after not talking to them, bc they hurt me and i needed a minute. that’s a whole other story), they didn’t want to be friends anymore. it seems pretty clear that i meant something to this person, given that they opened up to me about their trauma (and they’d opened up to me about things before that as well) and they always made me feel as if they cared about me. so why would they decide they don’t want to be friends? it’s like, i feel like i shouldn’t know this incredibly personal information about someone who’s not even my friend. i tried my very best to figure out the rationale, but they wouldn’t tell me why. is it bc they now associate me with their trauma, having told me about it? is it bc they didn’t like how i responded? do they feel uncomfortable around me knowing they really hurt me? did it have nothing to do with me? i wish they would tell me. this just breaks me, and i feel like i’m never gonna be able to move on until i understand what happened.

My teacher took us all outside and picked a few boys for one side and a few girls for the other side in tug of war (I know, a lil sexist, but it was 2010 so I forgive)
I was one of the girls and I was very opinionated and started yelling that’s not fair (not even because it was girls against boys, I was just kind of too competitive and most of the girls she picked were really small/weak so I was mad that I didn’t think they would try very hard lol)
And my teacher was like “hm, why don’t you think it’s fair?”
And I said “they’re bigger, they’re gonna win!”
She was like “idk maybe. Anyways, boys, if you win I will give each of you a penny. Girls, if you win, I will give each of you a dollar.”

7/12/2021 15:26:34,"re: 39798 I've never wished that I was in the wrong in a situation, but in general I also have a bias towards thinking that people are bad at apologizing. I guess I just want to say this is not true of everyone; for example, one of my friends is miraculously good at this to the point I think the reason we are still friends is our capacity to apologize to one another. So you definitely shouldn't lose hope. As for being on bad terms with others, I think this depends on what you mean by ""bad terms."" Sometimes it is necessary to cut people out of your life. This doesn't mean you should be rude to them, insult them or hurt them, but it's an act of self-preservation or of protecting yourself from harm, and I think that's understandable. Someone infinitely powerful like a god who is impervious to any pain could be on good terms with everyone, but we are all frail human beings who can sometimes only pretend to be Gods. Harmonious cooperation of some form is ideal, of course, but as you can also see now, it's sometimes improbable or impossible.

7/12/2021 22:51:15,"Here’s another really cool Pokemon fact! So Eternatus’s Eternamax form has a 250 base stat in each defense. This is actually high enough for an overflow error to occur during stat calculation, giving Eternatus-E base 0 in one of its defenses! (You only get this in one defense because the overflow requires a nature boost. How it works is the stat is calculated like normal, then to apply the nature boost, there are 2 steps: 1) multiply by 110, then 2) divide by 100. The overflow happens between these two steps.) This is extremely desirable because it allows Eternatus to take 2 damage from any attacks targeting the defense equal to 0! In damage calculation, you divide by defense, but instead of throwing an error when dividing by 0, the game replaces the whole thing with 0. At the very last step of damage calculation the game adds 2 (to ensure every attack does nonzero damage) so that’s why it’s 2 damage (and there are ways to increase this but never by much). You can’t use Eternamax without hacking the game, but it is allowed in some formats on Showdown! This fact means the entire strategy in these formats revolves around invincible (in one defense) Eternatus’s and ways to defeat them! (It’s actually very possible to do so! No Guard OHKO moves, mixed Shell Smashers, and residual damage like Spikes, Leech Seed, or even Curse all work well, especially when combined with things like trapping and Gastro Acid or Neutralizing Gas.)",39853,

7/13/2021 16:22:57,"The resubmit: I think it’s interesting how white feminism has its parallels in different societies and cultures around the world. Maybe each country has its own variation on it but I only wish to talk about the ones I have personal experience with either in my own life or from friends. 

So like for example, Singapore prices itself on being uber inclusive and friendly but there’s a lot of racism under the surface, particularly by the Chinese majority against the Malay and Indian minorities. I could make a separate post if anyone would like providing more details on what racism is like in Singapore but for now the main point is that there are many ethnically Chinese feminists who are very pro-feminism and pro-LGBT (as they should be!!) and yet severely lack any appreciation for intersectionality and ignore or even undermine the racial struggles of Malays and Indians. 

Similar situations are also present in India and Israel. Feminism is becoming really common in India, especially in bigger cities (as it should!!) and yet some of the women most vocal about women’s rights and LGBT rights often ignore, undermine, or sometimes attack against claims of casteism and Islamophobia in India, many of them being upper-caste themselves. Some have come to acknowledge their privilege publicly like Komal Pandey (who I have a decent amount of respect for) but most have not.

And I think a lot of people don’t realize just how anti-Palestinian much of the Israeli public is. It’s of course not everyone as a good chunk are in favor of the Palestinian cause (most notably that girl who ran a Twitter stan account for Taylor Swift and had to defend Taylor on Twitter while in jail because she refused to join the IDF), but anti-Palestinian sentiment is way more prevalent than just the ultra-conservatives of Israeli society, being also prevalent among many feminists known for promoting women’s rights and LGBT rights while also slandering the Palestinian cause.

My point is is that white feminism is arguably most wel-known for its sore lack of intersectionality and overlooking of, sometimes even hostility against, the struggles of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities whose experiences are foreign to feminists who come from the majority group. While most know (hopefully) how white feminism is sorely lacking in intersectionality today, particularly as it pertains to Black women, I hoped to shed some light on how equivalents of white feminism are present around the world in varying forms, at least forms I’m acquainted with.

One other interesting similarity is the performativeness of white feminism and its equivalents. In America, non-intersectional white feminists often reposted frequently about infographics during the height of BLM last year, and yet refused to make or ask for any substantial change within their own lives or communities. This was also often true of non-intersectional feminists in the countries I mentioned earlier. To give one example, it was often the same feminist influencers in India who proudly spoke up for and reposted infographics for BLM that also were silent, or even spoke against, state-supported violence against minorities in their country (e.g. the riots against Muslims in Delhi that occurred around the same time). Similarly, non-intersectional feminists in Israel and Singapore, and maybe other countries as well whose social status quo I’m not familiar with, proudly spoke up for BLM while neglecting the socioeconomic injustices in their own countries and communities.

I should conclude by adding that if it at any point seemed that I was trying to undermine BLM, I sincerely apologize. BLM was a long overdue and sorely needed movement in America, and this country as well as many others still has a lot of work to do in lifting up and supporting their Black populations. I mainly spoke about BLM as it’s the most recent example of performativeness among non-intersectional feminists globally.  ",39868,

Since someone asked me to substantiate claims of racism being a thing in Singapore:

I do want to preface this by expressing my displeasure at this request, not because I can’t follow through with it, but because I’d thought it was obvious how inexplicably callous it is to tell someone talking about the experience of racism that it isn’t that bad and that they need to prove themselves, especially when Google and the news are readily available nowadays (looking up ‘racism in singapore’ pulls up 18.8 million search results) Picture a White man telling a Black woman that racism isn’t actually that bad in America and that she needs to be ready to debate if she wants to be believed. It would be inappropriate for a White man to expect a Black woman to perform the emotional labor of proving her trauma especially when so much has been published on it and is easily accessible but here we are.

But anyway, there’s of course the fact that Singapore has had implicit racism bakes into its society from the founding. The well-loved founder of Singapore was a proud eugenicist who was not afraid to proclaim how Singapore only developed as fast as it did because of the ingenuity of the Chinese majority and could not have done so if Indians and/or Malays were the majority.

But however acclaimed a man he might be, that is at the end of the day still just the statements of one man and one man only. So how is racism then expressed in Singapore today? Well for the most part in the same way as it is expressed in most countries: primarily, but not exclusively, microaggressions. For example:

* Many people will make snide remarks if you are a Chinese woman dating a Malay or Indian man, and I have heard stories from Chinese friends about people rebuking them in public for saying out of their race, and a Malay/Indian of all people.
* Multiple Indian Singaporean have told me about how they felt their ethnically Chinese teachers for mad at them in ways they didn’t with the other students, and how many refused to shake hands with them or have any physical contact with them when they did so openly with other ethnically Chinese students.
* Subtle racism is constantly perpetuated in the media with just one example being about how Malay and Indian dishes are often ridiculed as overly fatty or unhealthy while being in chic when prepared or promoted by Chinese or Peranakan chefs.
* The famous incident of a family who newly immigrated to Singapore from Mainland China and had moved in to a place where they had neighbors who were ethnically Indian but Singaporean natives and citizens. The newly-immigrant Chinese family, not used yet to other cultures and the smell of curry, complained about the smell of their neighbors’ curry. The Indian family apologized and made sure to have their vents and windows closed. That wasn’t enough for the Chinese family who demanded they stop cooking curry altogether, despite it being a quintessential dish. When taken to court, whereas the expectation was that since a compromise had already been made, the court would inform the newly immigrated family of widely-promoted Singaporean values of embracing others’ cultures. Instead, they sided with the Chinese family and banned the Indian family from cooking their curry.
    * It should be noted that this incident was widely rebuked in Singapore, including by many, many Chinese Singaporeans. However, my goal was to never say all Chinese in Singapore are racist supervillains or whatever it may be. Many, likely the majority at that, are great. However, that doesn’t delete the fact that many are racist and that has a big impact, like how many White people in America are racist and it’s a dialogue that needs to be had even if the majority arguably are not (although many people see themselves as not racist and continue to perpetuate microaggressions, often unknowingly)

We should also bear in mind that the majority of Indians in SE Asia are Dravidians (South Indians with Tamils the dominant group) who are themselves discriminated against in India by North Indians (mainly Hindi, Bengali and Punjabi speakers) for being darker skinned and for being non-Aryan.",39944,

He was telling me (two years ago) about the race dynamic in Singapore, about the ethnic Chinese majority and ethnic Indian and Malay minority. No need to rehash what’s already been said, but he said he felt really lucky to not have to grow up there, especially being Indian. 
No doubt Singapore is a beautiful place and I’d like to visit it one day, but that conversation with my uncle was a really eye opener to the fact that even things that look really great on the outside can be really flawed on the inside.
